<p class='c003'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>I think Scandinavian Paganism, to us here, is more interesting than any
other. It is, for one thing, the latest; it continued in these regions of
Europe till the eleventh century: eight hundred years ago the Norwegians
were still worshipers of Odin. It is interesting also as the creed of our
fathers; the men whose blood still runs in our veins, whom doubtless we
still resemble in so many ways. Strange: they did believe that, while we
believe so differently. Let us look a little at this poor Norse creed, for
many reasons. We have tolerable means to do it; for there is another
point of interest in these Scandinavian mythologies: that they have been
preserved so well.</p>

<p class='c004'>Neither is there no use in <i>knowing</i> something about this old Paganism
of our fathers. Unconsciously, and combined with higher things, it is in <i>us</i>
yet, that old faith withal. To know it consciously brings us into closer and
clearer relations with the past,—with our own possessions in the past. For
the whole past, as I keep repeating, is the possession of the present. The
past had always something <i>true</i>, and is a precious possession. In a different
time, in a different place, it is always some other <i>side</i> of our common human
nature that has been developing itself.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>America Not Discovered by Columbus</span> having
been so favorably received by the press generally,
as well as by many distinguished scholars, who
have expressed themselves in very flattering terms of
our recent <i>début</i> in English, we venture to appear
again; and, although the subject is somewhat different,
it still (as did the first) has its fountain head
in the literature of the North.</p>

<p class='c004'>We come, this time, encouraged by all your kind
words, with higher aspirations, and perhaps, too, with
less timidity and modesty. We come to ask your
opinion of Norse mythology. We come to ask whether
Norse mythology is not equally as worthy of your
attention as the Greek. Nay, we come to ask whether
you will not give the Norse the <i>preference</i>. We propose
to call your attention earnestly, in this volume,
to the merits of our common Gothic or Teutonic
inheritance, and to chat a few hours with you about
the imaginative, poetic and prophetic period of our
Gothic history.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are well aware that we are here giving you
a book full of imperfections so far as style, originality,
arrangement and external adornment of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>subject is concerned, and we shall not take it much
to heart, even if we are severely criticised in these
respects; we shall rather take it as an earnest admonition
to study and improve in language and composition
for the future.</p>

<p class='c004'>But, if the spirit of the book, that is, the cause
which we have undertaken to plead therein,—if that
be frowned down, or rejected, or laughed at, we shall
be the recipient of a most bitter disappointment, and
yet we shall not wholly despair. The time must
come, when our common Gothic inheritance will be
loved and respected. There will come men—ay,
there are already men in our midst who will advocate
and defend its rights on American soil with
sharper steel than ours. And, though we may find
but few roses and many thorns on our pathway, we
shall not suffer our ardor in our chosen field of
labor to be diminished. We are determined not to
be discouraged.</p>

<p class='c004'>What we claim for this work is, that it is
the <i>first complete and systematic presentation of the
Norse mythology in the English language</i>; and this
we think is a sufficient reason for our asking a
humble place upon your book-shelves. And, while we
make this claim, we fully appreciate the value of the
many excellent treatises and translations that have
appeared on this subject in England. We do not
undervalue the labors of Dasent, Thorpe, Pigott, Carlyle,
etc., but none of these give a comprehensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>account of all the deities and the myths in full.
There is, indeed, no work outside of Scandinavia
that covers the whole ground. So far as America is
concerned, the only work on Norse mythology that
has hitherto been published in this country is <span class='sc'>Barclay
Pennock’s</span> translation of the Norse Professor
Rudolph Keyser’s <i>Religion of the Northmen</i>. This is
indeed an excellent and scholarly work, and a valuable
contribution to knowledge; but, instead of <i>presenting</i>
the mythology of the Norsemen, it <i>interprets</i>
it; and Professor Keyser is yet one of the most
eminent authorities in the exposition of the Asa doctrine.
Pennock’s translation of Keyser is a book of
three hundred and forty-six pages, and of these only
<i>sixteen</i> are devoted to a synopsis of the mythology;
and it is, as the reader may judge, nothing but a
very brief synopsis. The remaining three hundred
and thirty pages contain a history of Old Norse literature,
an interpretation of the Odinic religion, and
an exhibition of the manner of <i>worship</i> among the
heathen Norsemen. In a word, Pennock’s book <i>presupposes</i>
a knowledge of the subject; and for one
who has this, we would recommend <i>Pennock’s</i> <span class='sc'>Keyser</span>
as the best work <i>extant</i> in English. We are
indebted to it for many valuable paragraphs in this
volume.</p>

<p class='c004'>This subject has, then, been investigated by many
able writers; and, in preparing this volume, we have
borrowed from their works all the light they could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>shed upon our pathway. The authors we have chiefly
consulted are named in the accompanying list. While
we have used their very phrase whenever it was convenient,
we have not followed them in a slavish
manner. We have made such changes as in our
judgment seemed necessary to give our work harmony
and symmetry throughout. We at first felt disposed
to give the reader a mere translation either of <abbr class='spell'>N.
M.</abbr> Petersen, or of Grundtvig, or of <abbr class='spell'>P. A.</abbr> Munch;
but upon further reflection we came to the conclusion
that we could treat the subject more satisfactorily
to ourselves, and fully as acceptably to our
readers, by sketching out a plan of our own, and
making free use of all the best writers upon this
subject. And as we now review our pages, we find
that <abbr class='spell'>N. M.</abbr> Petersen has served us the most. Much
of his work has been appropriated in an almost
unchanged form.</p>

<p class='c004'>Although many of the ideas set forth in this
work may seem new to American readers, yet they
are by no means wholly original. Many of them
have for many years been successfully advocated in
Scandinavian countries, and to some extent, also, in
Germany and England. Our aim has not at present
been so much to make original investigations, as—that
which is far more needed and to the purpose—to
give the fruits of the labors performed in the
North, and call the attention of the American public
earnestly to the wealth stored up in the Eddas
and Sagas of Iceland. No one can doubt the correctness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>of our position in this matter, when he
reflects that we now drawing near the close of
the <i>nineteenth</i> century, and have not yet had a complete
Norse mythology in the English language, while
the number of Greek and Roman mythologies is
legion. Bayard Taylor said to us, recently, that the
Scandinavian languages, in view of their rich literature,
in view of the light which this literature throws
upon early English history, and in view of the importance
of Icelandic in a successful study of English
and Anglo-Saxon, ought to be taught in every college
in Vinland; and that is the very pith of what
we have to say in this preface.</p>

<p class='c004'>We have had excellent aid from Dr. <abbr class='spell'>S. H.</abbr> Carpenter,
who combines broad general culture with a
thorough knowledge of Old English and Anglo-Saxon.
He has read every page of this work, and we hereby
thank him for the generous sympathy and advice
which he has invariably given us. To President
John Bascom we are under obligations for kind words
and valuable suggestions. We hereby extend heartfelt
thanks to Professor Willard Fiske, of Cornell University,
for aid and encouragement; to Mrs. Ole Bull,
for free use of her excellent library; and to the
poet, <abbr class='spell'>H. W.</abbr> Longfellow, for permitting us to make
extracts from his works, and to inscribe this volume
to him as the Nestor among American writers on
Scandinavian themes. May the persons here named
find that this our work, in spite of its faults, advances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>somewhat, the interest in the studies of Northern
literature in this country.</p>

<p class='c004'>While Mallet’s <i>Northern Antiquities</i> is a very
valuable work, we cannot but make known our
regrets that Blackwell’s edition of it ever was published.
Mr. Blackwell has in many ways injured the
cause which he evidently intended to promote. While
we, therefore, urge caution in the use of Mallet’s
<i>Northern Antiquities</i> by Blackwell, we can with all
our heart recommend such writers upon the North
as Dasent, Laing, Thorpe, Gosse, Pennock, Boyesen,
Marsh, Fiske, the Howitts, Pigott, Lord Dufferin,
Maurer, Möbius, Morris, Magnússon, Vigfusson, Hjaltalin,
and several others.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is sincerely hoped that by this our effort we
may, at least for the present, fill a gap in English
literature, and accomplish something in awakening
among students some interest in Norse mythology,
history, literature and institutions. Let it be remembered,
that Carlyle, and many others of our best
scholars, claim that it is from the Norsemen we have
derived our vital energy, our freedom of thought,
and, in a measure that we do not yet suspect, our
strength of speech.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are conscious that our work contains many
imperfections, and that others might have performed
the task better; and thus we commend this volume
to the kind indulgence of the critic and the reader.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>LIST OF WORKS CONSULTED.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The following authors have been consulted in
preparing this work, and to them the reader is
referred, if he wishes to make special study of the
subject of Norse mythology.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of the Elder Edda we have used Benjamin Thorpe’s
translation and Sophus Bugge’s edition of the original.
It has been found necessary to make a few alterations
in Thorpe’s translation. Of the Younger Edda
we have used Dasent’s translation and Sveinbjorn
Egilsson’s edition of the original. Of modern Scandinavian
writers we have confined ourselves mainly
to <abbr class='spell'>N. M.</abbr> Petersen, <abbr class='spell'>N. F. S.</abbr> Grundtvig, <abbr class='spell'>P. A.</abbr> Munch,
Rudolph Keyser, Finn Magnússon, and Christian Winther.
Other authors borrowed from more or less are:
<abbr class='spell'>H. W.</abbr> Longfellow, <abbr class='spell'>H. G.</abbr> Möller, <abbr class='spell'>R.</abbr> Nyerup, <abbr class='spell'>E. G.</abbr>
Geier, <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> Hammerich, <abbr class='spell'>F. J.</abbr> Mone, Jacob Grimm,
Thomas Keightly, Thomas Carlyle, Max Müller, and
<abbr title='george'>Geo.</abbr> <abbr class='spell'>W.</abbr> Cox.</p>

<p class='c004'>The recent excellent work of Alexander Murray
has been referred to on the subject of Greek mythology.
It claims on its title-page to give an account
of Norse mythology; but we were surprised to find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>that the author dismisses the subject with fifteen
pages and a few wood-cuts of questionable value.</p>

<p class='c004'>The philological notes are chiefly based upon the
Icelandic Dictionary recently published by Macmillan
&amp; <abbr title='company'>Co.</abbr>, and edited by Gudbrand Vigfusson, of Oxford
University, England. We object to the price of it,
which is thirty-two dollars, but it is indeed a scholarly
work, and marks a new epoch in the study of
the Icelandic language.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the engraving opposite the title-page we are
indebted to Mr. James <abbr class='spell'>R.</abbr> Stuart, who has devoted many
years in America and Europe to the study of his art. The
painting, from which the engraving is made, is wholly
original, and was made expressly for this work. We
hereby extend our thanks to Mr. Stuart, and hope some
day to see more of Norse mythology treated by his brush.</p>

  <h3 id='chap0-1' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='1'>I</abbr>. <br /> WHAT IS MYTHOLOGY AND WHAT IS NORSE MYTHOLOGY?</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The word mythology (μυθολογόα, from μῦθος, word,
tale, fable, and λόγοc, speech, discourse,) is of Greek origin,
and our vernacular tongue has become so adulterated
with Latin and Greek words; we have studied Latin
and Greek in place of English, Anglo-Saxon, Norse and
Gothic so long that we are always in a quandary (<i>qu’en
dirai-je?</i>), always tongue-tied when we attempt to speak
of something outside or above the daily returning cares
of life. Our own good old English words have been
crowded out by foreign ones; this is our besetting sin.
But, as the venerable Professor George Stephens remarks
in his elaborate work on Runic Monuments, we have
watered our mother tongue long enough with bastard
Latin; let us now brace and steel it with the life-water
of our own sweet and soft and rich and shining and
clear-ringing and manly and world-ranging, ever-dearest
<span class='sc'>English</span>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mythology is a system of myths; a collection of
popular legends, fables, tales, or stories, relating to the
gods, heroes, demons or other beings whose names have
been preserved in popular belief. Such tales are not
found in the traditions of the ancient Greeks, Hindoos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and Egyptians, only, but every nation has had its system
of mythology; and that of the ancient Norsemen
is more simple, earnest, miraculous, stupendous and
divine than any other mythological system of which
we have record.</p>

<p class='c004'>The myth is the oldest form of truth; and mythology
is the knowledge which the ancients had of the
Divine. The object of mythology is to find God and
come to him. Without a written revelation this may
be done in two ways: either by studying the intellectual,
moral and physical nature of man, for evidence of
the existence of God may be found in the proper study
of man; or by studying nature in the outward world
in its general structure, adaptations and dependencies;
and truthfully it may be said that God manifests himself
in nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our Norse forefathers (for it is their religion we are
to present in this volume) had no clearly-defined knowledge
of any god outside of themselves and nature.
Like the ancient Greeks, they had only a somewhat
vague idea about a supreme God, whom the rhapsodist
or skald in the Elder Edda (Hyndluljóð 43, 44) dare
not name, and whom few, it is said, ever look far
enough to see. In the language of the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then one is born</div>
      <div class='line'>Greater than all;</div>
      <div class='line'>He becomes strong</div>
      <div class='line'>With the strengths of earth;</div>
      <div class='line'>The mightiest king</div>
      <div class='line'>Men call him,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fast knit in peace</div>
      <div class='line'>With all powers.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then comes another</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet more mighty;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><i>But him dare I not</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Venture to name.</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Few further may look</div>
      <div class='line'>Than to where Odin</div>
      <div class='line'>To meet the wolf goes.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Odin goes to meet the Fenriswolf in Ragnarok (the
twilight of the gods; that is, the final conflict between
all good and evil powers); but now let the reader compare
the above passage from the Elder Edda with the
following passage from the seventeenth chapter of the
Acts of the Apostles:</p>

<p class='c010'>Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ Hill and said: Ye
men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious;
for as I passed by and beheld your devotions, I found
an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.
Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was of this same <i>unknown God</i> that one of the
ancient Greek poets had said, that in him we live and
move and have our being. Thus did the Greeks find
Jehovah in the labyrinth of their heathen deities; and
when we claim that the Norse mythology is more
<i>divine</i> than any other system of mythology known, we
mean by this assertion, that the supreme God is mentioned
and referred to oftener, and stands out in bolder
relief in the Norseman’s heathen belief, than in any
other.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a noticeable fact that long before Christianity
was introduced or had even been heard of in Iceland,
it is recorded that Ingemund the Old, a heathen Norseman,
bleeding and dying, prayed God to forgive Rolleif,
his murderer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another man of the heathen times, Thorkel Maane,
a supreme judge of Iceland, a man of unblemished life
and distinguished among the wisest magistrates of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>island during the time of the republic, avowed that he
would worship no other God but him who had created
the sun; and in his dying hour he prayed the Father
of Light to illuminate his soul in the darkness of death.
Arngrim Jonsson tells us that when Thorkel Maane
had arrived at the age of maturity and reflection, he
disdained a blind obedience to traditionary custom,
and employed much of his time in weighing the established
tenets of his countrymen by the standard of
reason. He divested his mind of all prejudice; he
pondered on the sublimity of nature, and guided himself
by maxims founded on truth and reason. By these
means he soon discovered not only the fallacy of that faith
which governed his countrymen, but became a convert
to the existence of a supreme power more mighty than
Thor or Odin. In his maker he acknowledged his God,
and to him alone directed his homage from a conviction
that none other was worthy to be honored and worshiped.
On perceiving the approach of death, this
pious and sensible man requested to be conveyed into
the open air, in order that, as he said, he might in his
last moments contemplate the glories of Almighty God,
who has created the heavens and the earth and all that
in them is.</p>

<p class='c004'>Harald Fairfax (Haarfager), the first sovereign of Norway,
the king that united Norway under his scepter in
the year 872, is another remarkable example in this
respect. He was accustomed to assist at the public
offerings made by his people in honor of their gods.
As no better or more pure religion was known in those
days, he acted with prudence in not betraying either
contempt or disregard for the prevailing worship of the
country, lest his subjects, stimulated by such example,
might become indifferent, not only to their sacred, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>also to their political, duties. Yet he rejected from his
heart these profane ceremonies, and believed in the
existence of a more powerful god, whom he secretly
adored. I swear, he once said, never to make my
offerings to an idol, but to that God alone whose omnipotence
has formed the world and stamped man with
his own image. It would be an act of folly in me to
expect help from him whose power and empire arises
from the accidental hollow of a tree or the peculiar
form of a stone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such examples illustrate how near the educated and
reflecting Norse heathen was in sympathy with Christianity,
and also go far toward proving that the object
of mythology is to find God and come to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Still we must admit that of this supreme God our
forefathers had only a somewhat vague conception; and
to many of them he was almost wholly unknown.
Their god was a natural human god, a person. There
can be no genuine poetry without impersonation, and a
perfect system of mythology is a finished poem. Mythology
is, in fact, religious truth expressed in poetical
language. It ascribes all events and phenomena in the
outward world to a personal cause. Each cause is some
divinity or other—some god or demon. In this manner,
when the ancients heard the echo from the woods
or mountains, they did not think, as we now do, that
the waves of sound were reflected, but that there stood
a dwarf, a personal being, who repeated the words
spoken by themselves. This dwarf had to have a history,
a biography, and this gave rise to a myth. To
our poetic ancestors the forces of nature were not veiled
under scientific names. As Carlyle truthfully remarks,
they had not yet learned to reduce to their fundamental
elements and lecture learnedly about this beautiful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>green, rock-built, flowery earth, with its trees, mountains
and many-sounding waters; about the great deep
sea of azure that swims over our heads, and about the
various winds that sweep through it. When they saw
the black clouds gathering and shutting out the king
of day, and witnessed them pouring out rain and ice
and fire, and heard the thunder roll, they did not think,
as we now do, of accumulated electricity discharged from
the clouds to the earth, and show in the lecture room
how something like these powerful shafts of lightning
could be ground out of glass or silk, but they ascribed
the phenomenon to a mighty divinity—Thor—who in
his thunder-chariot rides through the clouds and strikes
with his huge hammer, Mjolner. The theory of our
forefathers furnishes food for the imagination, for our
poetical nature, while the reflection of the waves of
sound and the discharge of electricity is merely dry
reasoning—mathematics and physics. To our ancestors
Nature presented herself in her naked, beautiful
and awful majesty; while to us in this age of Newtons,
Millers, Oersteds, Berzeliuses and Tyndalls, she is
enwrapped in a multitude of profound scientific phrases.
These phrases make us flatter ourselves that we have
fathomed her mysteries and revealed her secret workings,
while in point of fact we are as far from the real
bottom as our ancestors were. But we have robbed
ourselves to a sad extent of the poetry of nature. Well
might Barry Cornwall complain:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>O ye delicious fables! where the wave</div>
      <div class='line'>And the woods were peopled, and the air, with things</div>
      <div class='line in2'>So lovely! Why, ah! why has science grave</div>
      <div class='line'>Scattered afar your sweet imaginings?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The old Norsemen said: The mischief-maker Loke
cuts for mere sport the hair of the goddess Sif, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the gods compel him to furnish her new hair, Loke
gets dwarfs to forge for her golden hair, which grows
almost spontaneously. We, their prosaic descendants,
say: The heat (Loke) scorches the grass (Sif’s hair),
but the same physical agent (heat) sets the forces of
nature to work again, and new grass with golden
(that is to say bright) color springs up again.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus our ancestors spoke of all the workings of
nature as though they were caused by personal agents;
and instead of saying, as we now do, that winter follows
summer, and explaining how the annual revolutions
of the earth produce the changes that are called
seasons of the year, they took a more poetical view of
the phenomenon, and said that the blind god Hoder
(winter) was instigated by Loke (heat) to slay Balder
(the summer god).</p>

<p class='c004'>This idea of personifying the visible workings of
nature was so completely developed that prominent faculties
or attributes of the gods also were subject to
impersonation. Odin, it was said, had two ravens, Hugin
and Munin; that is, reflection and memory. They
sit upon his shoulders, and whisper into his ears.
Thor’s strength was redoubled whenever he girded himself
with Megingjarder, his belt of strength; his steel
gloves, with which he wielded his hammer, produced
the same effect. Nay, strength was so eminent a characteristic
with Thor that it even stands out apart from
him as an independent person, and is represented by
his son Magne (strength), who accompanies him on his
journeys against the frost-giants.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this manner a series of myths were formed and
combined into a system which we now call mythology;
a system which gave to our fathers gods whom they
worshiped, and in whom they trusted, and which gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>to us a mirror in which is reflected the popular life,
the intellectual and moral characteristics of our ancestors.
And these gods were indeed worthy of reverence;
they were the embodiments of the noblest thoughts and
purest feelings, but these thoughts and feelings could
not be awakened without a personified image. As soon
as the divine idea was born, it assumed a bodily form,
and, in order to give the mind a more definite comprehension
of it, it was frequently drawn down from
heaven and sculptured in wood or stone. The object
was by images to make manifest unto the senses the
attributes of the gods, and thus the more easily secure
the devotion of the people. The heathen had to see
the image of God, the image of the infinite thought
embodied in the god, or he would not kneel down and
worship. This idea of wanting something concrete,
something within the reach of the senses, we find deeply
rooted in human nature. Man does not want an abstract
god, but a <i>personal</i>, visible god, at least a visible
sign of his presence. And we who live in the broad
daylight of revealed religion and science ought not to
be so prone to blame our forefathers for paying divine
honors to images, statues and other representations or
symbols of their gods, for the images were, as the words
imply, not the gods themselves to whom the heathen
addressed his prayers and supplications, but merely the
symbols of these gods; and every religion, Christianity
included, is mythical in its development. The tendency
is to draw the divine down to earth, in order to rise
with it again to heaven. When God suffers with us, it
becomes easier for us to suffer; when he redeems us,
our salvation becomes certain. God is in all systems
of religion seen, as it were, through a glass—never face
to face. No one can see Jehovah and live.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Even as in our present condition our immortal soul
cannot do without the visible body, and cannot without
this reveal itself to its fellow-beings, so our faith
requires a visible church, our religion must assume
some form in which it can be apprehended by the
senses. Our faith is made stronger by the visible
church in the same manner as the mind gains knowledge
of the things about us by means of the bodily
organs. The outward rite or external form and ceremonial
ornament, which are so conspicuous in the
Roman and Greek Catholic churches, for instance, serve
to awaken, edify and strengthen the soul and assist the
memory in recalling the religious truths and the events
in the life of Christ and of the saints more vividly and
forcibly to the mind; besides, pictures and images are
to the unlettered what books are to those educated in
the art of reading. Did not Christ himself combine
things supersensual with things within the reach of the
senses? The purification and sanctification of the soul
he combined with the idea of cleansing the body in
the sacrament of baptism. The remembrance of him
and of his love, how he gave his body and blood for
the redemption of fallen man, he combined with the
eating of bread and drinking of wine in the sacrament
of the Lord’s Supper. He gave his religion an outward,
visible form; and, just as the soul is mirrored in the
eyes, in the expression of the countenance, in the gestures
and manners of the body, so our faith is reflected
in the church. This is what is meant by mythical
development; and when we discover this tendency
to cling to visible signs and ceremonies manifesting
itself so extensively even in the Christian church of
our own time, it should teach us to be less severe in
judging and blaming the heathen for their idol-worship.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>As long as the nations have inhabited the earth,
there have been different religions among men; and
how could this be otherwise? The countries which
they have inhabited; the skies which they have looked
upon; their laws, customs and social institutions; their
habits, language and knowledge; have differed so widely
that it would be absurd to look for uniformity in the
manner in which they have found, comprehended and
worshiped God. Nay, this is not all. Even among
Christians, and, if we give the subject a careful examination,
even among those who confess one and the same
faith and are members of one and the same church, we
find that the religion of one man is never perfectly
like that of another. They may use the same prayers,
learn and subscribe to the same confession, hear the
same preacher and take part in the same ceremonies,
but still the prayer, faith and worship of the one will
differ from the prayer, faith and worship of the other.
Two persons are never precisely alike, and every one
will interpret the words which he hears and the ceremonies
in which he takes part according to the depth
and breadth of his mind and heart—according to the
extent and kind of his knowledge and experience, and
according to other personal peculiarities and characteristics.
Even this is not all. Every person changes his
religious views as he grows older, as his knowledge and
experience increase, so that the faith of the youth is
not that of the child, nor does the man with silvery
locks approach the altar with precisely the same faith
as when he knelt there a youth. For it is not the
words and ceremonies, but the thoughts and feelings,
that we combine with these symbols, that constitute
our religion; it is not the confession which we learned
at school, but the ideas that are suggested by it in our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>minds, and the emotions awakened by it in our hearts,
that constitute our faith.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the preachers of the Christian religion realized
these truths more than they generally seem to do, they
would perhaps speak with more charity and less scorn
and contempt of people who differ from them in their
religious views. They would recognize in the faith of
others the same connecting link between God and man
for them, as their own faith is for themselves. They
would not hate the Jew because he, in accordance with
the Mosaic commandment, offers his prayers in the
synagogue to the God of his fathers; nor despise the
heathen because <i>he</i>, in want of better knowledge, in
childlike simplicity lifts his hands in prayer to an image
of wood or stone; for, although this be perishable
dust, he still addresses the prayer of his inmost soul to
the supreme God, even as the child, that kisses the
picture of his absent mother, actually thinks of her.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old mythological stories of the Norsemen abound
in poetry of the truest and most touching character.
These stories tell us in sublime and wonderful speech
of the workings of external nature, and may make us
cheerful or sad, happy or mournful, gay or grave, just
as we night feel, if from the pinnacle of Gausta Fjeld
we were to watch the passing glories of morning and
evening tide. There is nothing in these stories that
can tend to make us less upright and simple, while
they contain many thoughts and suggestions that we
may be the better and happier for knowing. All the
so-called disagreeable features of mythology are nothing
but distortions, brought out either by ill-will or by a
superficial knowledge of the subject; and, when these
distortions are removed, we shall find only things beautiful,
lovely and of good report. We shall find the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>simple thoughts of our childlike, imaginative, poetic and
prophetic forefathers upon the wonderful works of their
maker, and nothing that we may laugh at, or despise,
or <i>pity</i>. These words of our fathers, if read in the
right spirit, will make us feel as we ought to feel when
we contemplate the glory and beauty of the heavens
and the earth, and observe how wonderfully all things
are adapted to each other and to the wants of man,
that the thoughts of him who stands at the helm of
this ship of the universe (Skidbladner) must be very
deep, and that we are sensible to the same joys and
sufferings, are actuated by the same fears and hopes
and passions, that were felt by the men and women
who lived in the dawn of our Gothic history. We will
begin to realize how the great and wise Creator has led
our race on—slowly, perhaps, but nevertheless surely—to
the consciousness that he is a loving and righteous
Father, and that he has made the sun and moon and
stars, the earth, and all that in them is, in their season.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Norse mythology reflects, then, the religious,
moral, intellectual and social development of our ancestors
in the earliest period of their existence. We say
<i>our</i> ancestors, for we must bear in mind that in its
most original form this mythology was common to all
the Teutonic nations, to the ancestors of the Americans
and the English, as well as to those of the Norsemen,
Swedes and Danes. Geographically it extended not only
over the whole of Scandinavia, including Iceland, but
also over England and a considerable portion of France
and Germany. But it is only in Iceland, that weird
island of the icy sea, with the snow-clad volcano <abbr title='mount'>Mt.</abbr>
Hecla for its hearth, encircled by a wall of glaciers,
and with the roaring North Sea for its grave,—it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>only in Iceland that anything like a complete record
of this ancient Teutonic mythology was put in writing
and preserved; and this fact alone ought to be
quite sufficient to lead us to cultivate a better acquaintance
with the literature of Scandinavia. To use the
words of that excellent Icelandic scholar, the Englishman
George Webbe Dasent: It is well known, says
he, that the Icelandic language, which has been preserved
almost incorrupt in that remarkable island, has
remained for many centuries the depository of literary
treasures, the common property of all the Scandinavian
and Teutonic races, which would otherwise have perished,
as they have perished in Norway, Denmark,
Sweden, Germany and England. There was a time
when all these countries had a common mythology,
when the royal race each of them traced its descent
in varying genealogies up to Odin and the gods of
Asgard. Of that mythology, <i>which may hold its own
against any other that the world has seen</i>, all memory,
as a systematic whole, has vanished from the mediæval
literature of Teutonic Europe. With the introduction
of Christianity, the ancient gods had been deposed
and their places assigned to devils and witches. Here
and there a tradition, a popular tale or a superstition
bore testimony to what had been lost; and, though
in this century the skill and wisdom of the Grimms
and their school have shown the world what power
of restoration and reconstruction abides in intelligent
scholarship and laborious research, <i>even the
genius of the great master of that school of criticism
would have lost nine-tenths of its power had not faithful
Iceland preserved through the dark ages the two
Eddas, which present to us, in features that cannot be
mistaken, and in words which cannot die, the very form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and fashion of that wondrous edifice of mythology which
our forefathers in the dawn of time imagined to themselves
as the temple at once of their gods and of the
worship due to them from all mankind on this middle
earth</i>. For man, according to their system of belief,
could have no existence but for those gods and stalwart
divinities, who, from their abode in Asgard, were ever
watchful to protect him and crush the common foes of
both, the earthly race of giants, or, in other words, the
chaotic natural powers. Any one, therefore, that desires
to see what manner of men his forefathers were in their
relation to the gods, how they conceived their theogony,
how they imagined and constructed their cosmogony,
must betake himself to the Eddas, as illustrated by the
Sagas, and he will there find ample details on all these
points; while the Anglo-Saxon and Teutonic literatures
only throw out vague hints and allusions. As we read
Beowulf and the Traveler’s Song, for instance, we meet
at every step references to mythological stories and mythical
events, which would be utterly unintelligible were
it not for the full light thrown upon them by the Icelandic
literature. Thus far Dasent’s opinion.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Norse mythology, we say, then, shows what the
religion of our ancestors was; and their religion is the
main fact that we care to know about them. Knowing
this well, we can easily account for the rest. Their religion
is the soul of their history. Their religion tells
us what they felt; their feelings produced their thoughts,
and their thoughts were the parents of their acts. When
we study their religion, we discover the unseen and
spiritual fountain from which all their outward acts
welled forth, and by which the character of these was
determined.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mythology is neither the history nor the poetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>nor the natural philosophy of our ancestors; but it is
the germ and nucleus of them all. It <i>is</i> history, for it
treats of events; but it is <i>not</i> history in the ordinary
acceptance of that word, for the persons figuring therein
have never existed. It <i>is</i> natural philosophy, for it investigates
the origin of nature; but it is <i>not</i> natural
philosophy according to modern ideas, for it personifies
and deifies nature. It <i>is</i> metaphysics, for it studies the
science and the laws of being; but it is <i>not</i> metaphysics
in our sense of the word, for it rapidly overleaps all
categories. It is poetry in its very essence; but its pictures
are streams that flow together. Thus the Norse
mythology is history, but limited to neither time nor
place; poetry, but independent of arses or theses; philosophy,
but without abstractions or syllogisms.</p>

<p class='c004'>We close this chapter with the following extract from
Thomas Carlyle’s essays on Heroes and Hero-worship;
an extract that undoubtedly will be read with interest
and pleasure:</p>

<p class='c010'>In that strange island—Iceland—burst up, the geologists
say, by fire, from the bottom of the sea; a wild land of barrenness
and lava; swallowed, many months of the year, in black
tempests, yet with a wild, gleaming beauty in summer-time;
towering up there, stern and grim, in the North Ocean; with
its snow-jökuls, roaring geysers, sulphur pools and horrid volcanic
chasms, like the waste, chaotic battle-field of frost and fire—where
of all places we least looked for literature or written
memorials; the record of these things was written down. On
the seaboard of this wild land is a rim of grassy country, where
cattle can subsist, and men, by means of them and of what the
sea yields; and it seems they were poetic men, these—men who
had deep thoughts in them, and uttered musically their thoughts.
Much would be lost had Iceland not been burst up from the
sea—not been discovered by the Northmen! The old Norse
poets were many of them natives of Iceland.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sæmund, one of the early Christian priests there, who perhaps
had a lingering fondness for paganism, collected certain of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>their old pagan song, just about becoming obsolete then—poems
or chants, of a mythic, prophetic, mostly all of a religious,
character: this is what Norse critics call the <i>Elder</i> or
Poetic <i>Edda</i>. <i>Edda</i>, a word of uncertain etymology, is thought
to signify <i>Ancestress</i>. Snorre Sturleson, an Iceland gentleman,
an extremely notable personage, educated by this Sæmund’s
grandson, took in hand next, near a century afterwards, to put
together, among several other books he wrote, a kind of prose
synopsis of the whole mythology, elucidated by new fragments
of traditionary verse; a work constructed really with great
ingenuity, native talent, what one might call unconscious art;
altogether a perspicuous, clear work—pleasant reading still.
This is the <i>Younger</i> or Prose <i>Edda</i>. By these and the numerous
other <i>Sagas</i>, mostly Icelandic, with the commentaries, Icelandic
or not, which go on zealously in the North to this day, it is
possible to gain some direct insight even yet, and see that old
system of belief, as it were, face to face. Let as forget that it
is erroneous religion: let us look at it as old thought, and try
if we cannot sympathize with it somewhat.</p>

<p class='c011'>The primary characteristic of this old Northland mythology
I find to be impersonation of the visible workings of nature—earnest,
simple recognition of the workings of physical nature,
as a thing wholly miraculous, stupendous and divine. What we
now lecture of as science, they wondered at, and fell down in
awe before, as religion. The dark, hostile powers of nature
they figured to themselves as <i>Jötuns</i> (giants), huge, shaggy
beings, of a demoniac character. Frost, Fire, Sea, Tempest, these
are <i>Jötuns</i>. The friendly powers, again, as Summer-heat, the
Sun, are gods. The Empire of this Universe is divided between
these two; they dwell apart in perennial internecine feud. The
gods dwell above in <i>Asgard</i>, the Garden of the <i>Asas</i>, or Divinities;
<i>Jötunheim</i>, a distant, dark, chaotic land, is the home of
the Jötuns.</p>

<p class='c011'>Curious, all this; and not idle or inane if we will look at
the foundation of it. The power of <i>Fire</i> or <i>Flame</i>, for instance,
which we designate by some trivial chemical name, thereby hiding
from ourselves the essential character of wonder that dwells
in it, as in all things, is, with these old Northmen, <i>Loge</i>, a most
swift, subtle demon, of the brood of the Jötuns. The savages
of the Ladrones Islands, too (say some Spanish voyagers), thought
Fire, which they had never seen before, was a devil, or god,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>that bit you sharply when you touched it, and lived there upon
dry wood. From us, too, no chemistry, if it had not stupidity
to help it, would hide that flame is a wonder. What is flame?
Frost the old Norse seer discerns to be a monstrous, hoary
Jötun, the giant <i>Thrym</i>, <i>Hrym</i>, or <i>Rime</i>, the old word, now nearly
obsolete here, but still used is Scotland to signify hoar-frost.
<i>Rime</i> was not then, as now, a dead chemical thing, but a living
Jötun, or Devil; the monstrous Jötun <i>Rime</i> drove home his
horses at night, sat combing their manes;—which horses were
<i>Hail-clouds</i>, or fleet <i>Frost-winds</i>. His cows—no, not his, but a
kinsman’s, the giant Hymer’s cows—are <i>Icebergs</i>. This Hymer
looks at the rocks with his devil-eye, and they <i>split</i> in the
glance of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thunder was then not mere electricity, vitreous or resinous;
it was the god Donner (Thunder), or Thor,—god, also, of
the beneficent Summer-heat. The thunder was his wrath; the
gathering of the black clouds is the drawing down of Thor’s
angry brows; the fire-bolt bursting out of heaven is the all-rending
hammer flung from the hand of Thor. He urges his
loud chariot over the mountain tops—that is the peal; wrathful
he blows in his red beard—that is the rustling storm-blast
before the thunder begins. Balder, again, the White
God, the beautiful, the just and benignant, (whom the early
Christian missionaries found to resemble Christ,) is the sun—beautifulest
of visible things: wondrous, too, and divine still,
after all our astronomies and almanacs! But perhaps the notablest
god we hear tell of is one of whom Grimm, the German
etymologist, finds trace: the god Wünsch, or Wish. The god
<i>Wish</i>, who could give us all that we <i>wished</i>! Is not this the
sincerest and yet the rudest voice of the spirit of man? The
<i>rudest</i> ideal that man ever formed, which still shows itself in
the latest forms of our spiritual culture. Higher considerations
have to teach us that the god <i>Wish</i> is not the true God.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the other gods or Jötuns, I will mention, only for etymology’s
sake, that Sea-tempest is the Jötun <i>Ægir</i>, a very dangerous
Jötun; and now to this day, on our river Trent, as I
learn, the Nottingham bargemen, when the river is in a certain
flooded state (a kind of back-water or eddying swirl it has, very
dangerous to them), call it <i>Eager</i>. They cry out, Have a care!
there is the <i>Eager</i> coming! Curious, that word surviving, like
the peak of a submerged world! The <i>oldest</i> Nottingham barge-men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>had believed in the god Ægir. Indeed, our English blood,
too, in good part, is Danish, Norse,—or rather, at the bottom,
Danish and Norse and Saxon have no distinction except a
superficial one—as of Heathen and Christian, or the like. But
all over our island we are mingled largely with Danes proper—from
the incessant invasions there were; and this, of course,
in a greater proportion along the east coast; and greatest of all,
as I find, in the north country. From the Humber upward, all
over Scotland, the speech of the common people is still in
singular degree Icelandic; its Germanism has still a peculiar
Norse tinge. They, too, are Normans, Northmen—if that be
any great beauty!</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the chief god, Odin, we shall speak by-and-by. Mark,
at present, so much: what the essence of Scandinavian, and,
indeed, of all paganism, is: a recognition of the forces of nature
as godlike, stupendous, personal agencies—as gods and demons.
Not inconceivable to us. It is the infant thought of man opening
itself with awe and wonder on this ever stupendous universe.
It is strange, after our beautiful Apollo statues and
clear smiling mythuses, to come down upon the Norse gods
brewing ale to hold their feast with Aegir, the Sea-Jötun;
sending out Thor to get the caldron for them in the Jötun
country; Thor, after many adventures, clapping the pot on his
head, like a huge hat, and walking off with it—quite lost in it,
the ear of the pot reaching down to his heels! A kind of
vacant hugeness, large, awkward gianthood, characterizes that
Norse system; enormous force, as yet altogether untutored,
stalking helpless, with large, uncertain strides. Consider only
their primary mythus of the Creation. The gods having got the
giant Ymer slain—a giant made by warm winds and much
confused work out of the conflict of Frost and Fire—determined
on constructing a world with him. His blood made the sea;
his flesh was the Land; the Rocks, his bones; of his eyebrows
they formed Asgard, their gods’ dwelling; his skull was the
great blue vault of Immensity, and the brains of it became the
Clouds. What a Hyper-Brobdignagian business! Untamed
thought; great, giantlike, enormous; to be tamed, in due time,
into the compact greatness, not giantlike, but godlike, and
stronger than gianthood of the Shakespeares, the Goethes!
Spiritually, as well as bodily, these men are our progenitors.</p>

  <h3 id='chap0-2' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. <br /> WHY CALL THIS MYTHOLOGY NORSE? OUGHT IT NOT RATHER TO BE CALLED GOTHIC OR TEUTONIC?</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In its original form, the mythology, which is to be
presented in this volume, was common to all the Teutonic
nations; and it spread itself geographically over
England, the most of France and Germany, as well as
over Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland. But
when the Teutonic nations parted, took possession of
their respective countries, and began to differ one nation
from the other, in language, customs and social and
political institutions, and were influenced by the peculiar
features of the countries which they respectively
inhabited, then the germ of mythology which each nation
brought with it into its changed conditions of life,
would also be subject to changes and developments in
harmony and keeping with the various conditions of
climate, language, customs, social and political institutions,
and other influences that nourished it, while the
fundamental myths remained common to all the Teutonic
nations. Hence we might in one sense speak of
a Teutonic mythology. That would then be the mythology
of the Teutonic peoples, as it was known to
them while they all lived together, some four or five
hundred years before the birth of Christ, in the south-eastern
part of Russia, without any of the peculiar features
that have been added later by any of the several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>branches of that race. But from this time we have no
Teutonic literature. In another sense, we must recognize
a distinct German mythology, a distinct English
mythology, and even make distinction between the mythologies
of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway.</p>

<p class='c004'>That it is only of the Norse mythology we have
anything like a complete record, was alluded to in the
first chapter; but we will now make a more thorough
examination of this fact.</p>

<p class='c004'>The different branches of the Teutonic mythology
died out and disappeared as Christianity gradually
became introduced, first in France, about five hundred
years after the birth of Christ; then in England, one
or two hundred years later; still later, in Germany,
where the Saxons, Christianized by Charlemagne about
<abbr class='spell'>A.D.</abbr> 800, were the last heathen people.</p>

<p class='c004'>But in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland, the
original Gothic heathenism lived longer and more independently
than elsewhere, and had more favorable opportunities
to grow and mature. The ancient mythological
or pagan religion flourished here until about the middle
of the eleventh century; or, to speak more accurately,
Christianity was not completely introduced in Iceland
before the beginning of the eleventh century; in Denmark
and Norway, some twenty to thirty years later;
while in Sweden, paganism was not wholly eradicated
before 1150.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yet neither Norway, Sweden nor Denmark give us
any mythological literature. This is furnished us only
by the Norsemen, who had settled in Iceland. Shortly
after the introduction of Christianity, which gave the
Norsemen the so-called Roman alphabetical system
instead of their famous Runic <i>futhorc</i>, there was put
in writing in Iceland a colossal mythological and historical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>literature, which is the full-blown flower of
Gothic paganism. In the other countries inhabited
by Gothic (Scandinavian, Low Dutch and English) and
Germanic (High German) races, scarcely any mythological
literature was produced. The German <i>Niebelungen-Lied</i>
and the Anglo-Saxon <i>Beowulf’s Drapa</i> are
at best only semi-mythological. The overthrow of heathendom
was too abrupt and violent. Its eradication
was so complete that the heathen religion was almost
wholly obliterated from the memory of the people.
Occasionally there are found authors who refer to it,
but their allusions are very vague and defective, besides
giving unmistakable evidence of being written with prejudice
and contempt. Nor do we find among the early
Germans that spirit of veneration for the memories of
the past, and desire to perpetuate them in a vernacular
literature; or if they did exist, they were smothered by
the Catholic priesthood. When the Catholic priests
gained the ascendancy, they adopted the Latin language
and used that exclusively for recording events, and they
pronounced it a sin even to mention by name the old pagan
gods oftener than necessity compelled them to do so.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the Norsemen, on the other hand, and to a
considerable extent among the English, too, the old
religion flourished longer; the people cherished their
traditions; they loved to recite the songs and Sagas,
in which were recorded the religious faith and brave
deeds of their ancestors, and cultivated their native
speech in spite of the priests. In Iceland at least, the
priests did not succeed in rooting out paganism, if you
please, before it had developed sufficiently to produce
those beautiful blossoms, the Elder and Younger Eddas.
The chief reason of this was, that the people continued
to use their mother-tongue, in writing as well as in speaking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>so that Latin, the language of the church, never
got a foothold. It was useless for the monks to try to
tell Sagas in Latin, for they found but few readers in
that tongue. An important result of this was, that
the Saga became the property of the people, and not of
the favored few. In the next place, our Norse Icelandic
ancestors took a profound delight in poetry and song.
The skald sung in the mother-speech, and taking the
most of the material for his songs and poems from the
old mythological tales, it was necessary to study and
become familiar with these, in order that he might be
able, on the one hand, to understand the productions
of others, and, on the other, to compose songs himself.
Among the numerous examples which illustrate how
tenaciously the Norsemen clung to their ancient divinities,
we may mention the skald Hallfred, who, when
he was baptized by the king Olaf Tryggvesson, declared
bravely to the king, that he would neither speak ill of
the old gods, nor refrain from mentioning them in his
songs.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reason, then, why we cannot present a complete
and thoroughly systematic Teutonic or German or English
or Danish or Swedish Mythology, is not that these
did not at some time exist, but because their records
are so defective. Outside of Norway and Iceland,
Christianity, together with disregard of past memories,
has swept most of the resources, with which to construct
them, away from the surface, and there remain only
deeply buried ruins, which it is difficult to dig up and
still more difficult to polish and adjust into their original
symmetrical and comprehensive form after they
have been brought to the surface. It is difficult to
gather all the scattered and partially decayed bones of
the mythological system, and with the breath of human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>intellect reproduce a living vocal organism. Few have
attempted to do this with greater success than the
brothers Grimm.</p>

<p class='c004'>For the elucidation of our mythology in its Germanic
form, for instance, the materials, although they
are not wholly wanting, are yet difficult to make use
of, since they are widely scattered, and must be sought
partly in quite corrupted popular legends, partly in
writings of the middle ages, where they are sometimes
found interpolated, and where we often least should
expect to find them. But in its Norse form we have
ample material for studying the Asa-mythology. Here
we have as our guide not only a large number of
skaldic lays, composed while the mythology still flourished,
but even a complete religious system, written
down, it is true, after Christianity had been introduced
in Iceland, still, according to all evidence, without the
Christian ideas having had any special influence upon
its delineation, or having materially corrupted it. These
lays, manuscripts, etc., which form the source of Norse
mythology, will be more fully discussed in another
chapter of this Introduction.</p>

<p class='c004'>We may add further, that if we had, in a complete
system, the mythology of the Germans, the English,
etc., we should find, in comparing them with the Norse,
the same correspondence and identity as see find existing
between the different branches of the Teutonic
family of languages. We should find in its essence the
same mythology in all the Teutonic countries, we should
find this again dividing itself into two groups, the Germanic
and the Gothic, and the latter group, that is, the
Gothic, would include the ancient religion of the Scandinavians,
English, and Low Dutch. If we had sufficient
means for making a comparison, we should find that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>any single myth may have become more prominent,
may have become more perfectly developed by one branch
of the race than by another; one branch of the great
Teutonic family may have become more attached to a
certain myth than another, while the myth itself
would remain identical everywhere. Local myths, that
is, myths produced by the contemplation of the visible
workings of external nature, are colored by the atmosphere
of the people and country where they are fostered.
The god Frey received especial attention by the Asa-worshipers
in Sweden, but the Norse and Danish Frey
are still in reality the same god. Thunder produces not
the same effect upon the people among the towering
and precipitous mountains of Norway and the level
plains of Denmark, but the Thor of Norway and of
Denmark are still the same god; although in Norway
he is tall a mountain, his beard is briers, and he
rushes upon his heroic deeds with the strength and
frenzy of a berserk, while in Denmark he wanders along
the sea-shore, a youth, with golden looks and downy
beard.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is the Asa-mythology, as it was conceived and
cherished by the Norsemen of Norway and Iceland,
which the Old Norse literature properly presents to us,
and hence the myths will in this volume be presented
in their Norse dress, and hence its name, <i>Norse Mythology</i>.
From what has already been said, there is no
reason to doubt that the Swedes and Danes professed
in the main the same faith, followed the same religious
customs, and had the same religious institutions; and
upon this supposition other English writers upon this
subject, as for instance Benjamin Thorpe, have entitled
their books <i>Scandinavian Mythology</i>. But we do not
know the details of the religious faith, customs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>institutions of Sweden and Denmark, for all reliable
inland sources of information are wanting, and all the
highest authorities on this subject of investigation, such
as Rudolph Keyser, <abbr class='spell'>P. A.</abbr> Munch, Ernst Sars, <abbr class='spell'>N. M.</abbr>
Petersen and others, unanimously declare, that although
the ancient Norse-Icelandic writings not unfrequently
treat of heathen religious affairs in Sweden and Denmark,
yet, when they do, it is always in such a manner
that the conception is clearly <i>Norse</i>, and the delineation
is throughout adapted to institutions as they existed in
Norway. We are aware that there are those who will
feel inclined to criticise us for not calling this mythology
Scandinavian or Northern (a more elastic term),
but we would earnestly recommend them to examine
carefully the writings of the above named writers before
waxing too zealous on the subject.</p>

<p class='c004'>As we closed the previous chapter, with an extract
from Thomas Carlyle, so we will close this chapter with
a brief quotation frown an equally eminent scholar, the
author of <i>Chips from a German Workshop</i>. In the
second volume of that work Max Müller says:<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>There is, after Anglo-Saxon, no language, no literature, no
mythology so full of interest for the elucidation of the earliest
history of the race which now inhabits these British isles as the
Icelandic. Nay, in one respect Icelandic beats every other dialect
of the great Teutonic family of speech, not excepting Anglo-Saxon
and Old High German and Gothic. It is in Icelandic alone
that we find complete remains of genuine Teutonic heathendom.
Gothic as <i>a language</i>, is more ancient than Icelandic; but the
only literary work which we we possess in Gothic is a translation
of the Bible. The Anglo-Saxon literature, with the exception of
the Beowulf, is Christian. The old heroes of the Niebelunge,
such as we find them represented in the Suabian epic, have been
converted into church-going knights; whereas, in the ballads of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the Elder Edda, Sigurd and Brynhild appear before us in their
full pagan grandeur, holding nothing sacred but their love, and
defying all laws, human and divine, in the name of that one
almighty passion. The Icelandic contains the key to many a
riddle in the English language and to many a mystery in the
English character. Though the Old Norse is but a dialect of
the same language which the Angles and Saxons brought to
Britain, though the Norman blood is the same blood that floods
and ebbs in every German heart, yet there is an accent of defiance
in that rugged northern speech, and a spring of daring
madness in that throbbing northern heart, which marks the
Northman wherever he appears, whether in Iceland or in Sicily,
whether on the Seine or on the Thames. At the beginning of the
ninth century, when the great northern exodus began, Europe, as
Dr. Dasent remarks, was in danger of becoming too comfortable.
The two nations destined to run neck-and-neck in the great race
of civilization, Frank and Anglo-Saxon, had a tendency to become
dull and lazy, and neither could arrive at perfection till it had
been chastised by the Norsemen, and finally forced to admit an
infusion of northern blood into its sluggish veins. The vigor of
the various branches of the Teutonic stock may be measured by
the proportion of Norman blood which they received; and the
national character of England owes more to the descendants of
Hrolf Ganger<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> than to the followers of Hengist and Horsa.</p>

<p class='c011'>But what is known of the early history of the Norsemen?
Theirs was the life of reckless freebooters, and they had no time
to dream and ponder on the past, which they had left behind in
Norway. Where they settled as colonists or as rulers, their own
traditions, their very language, were soon forgotten. Their language
has nowhere struck root on foreign ground, even where,
as in Normandy, they became earls of Rouen, or, as in these isles,
kings of England. There is but one exception—Iceland. Iceland
was discovered, peopled and civilized by Norsemen in the
ninth century; and in the nineteenth century the language
spoken there is still the dialect of Harald Fairhair, and the
stories told there are still the stories of the Edda, or the Venerable
Grandmother. Dr. Dasent gives us a rapid sketch of the
first landings of the Norse refugees on the fells and forths of
Iceland. He describes how love of freedom drove the subjects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of Harald Fairhair forth from their home; how the Teutonic
tribes, though they loved their kings, the sons of Odin, and
sovereigns by the grace of God, detested the dictatorship of
Harald. He was a mighty warrior, so says the ancient Saga, and
laid Norway under him, and put out of the way some of those
who held districts, and some of them he drove out of the land;
and besides, many men escaped out of Norway because of the
overbearing of Harald Fairhair, for they would not stay to be
subjects to him. These early emigrants were pagans, and it was
not till the end of the tenth century that Christianity reached
the Ultima Thule of Europe. The missionaries, however, who
converted the freemen of Iceland, were freemen themselves.
They did not come with the pomp and the pretensions of the
church of Rome. They preached Christ rather than the Pope;
they taught religion rather than theology. Nor were they afraid
of the old heathen gods, or angry with every custom that was
not of Christian growth. Sometimes this tolerance may have
been carried too far, for we read of kings, like Helge, who
mixed in their faith, who trusted in Christ, but at the same time
invoked Thor’s aid whenever they went to sea or got into any
difficulty. But on the whole, the kindly feeling of the Icelandic
priesthood toward the national traditions and customs and prejudices
of their converts must have been beneficial. Sons and
daughters were not forced to call the gods whom their fathers
and mothers had worshiped, devils; and they were allowed to
use the name of Allfadir, whom they had invoked in the prayers
of their childhood, when praying to Him who is our Father in
Heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Icelandic missionaries had peculiar advantages in their
relation to the system of paganism which they came to combat.
Nowhere else, perhaps, in the whole history of Christianity, has
the missionary been brought face to face with a race of gods
who were believed by their own worshipers to be doomed to
death. The missionaries had only to proclaim that Balder was
dead, that the mighty Odin and Thor were dead. The people
knew that these gods were to die, and the message of the One
Everliving God must have touched their ears and their hearts
with comfort and joy. Thus, while in Germany the priests
were occupied for a long time in destroying every trace of heathenism,
in condemning every ancient lay as the work of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>devil, in felling sacred trees and abolishing national customs,
the missionaries of Iceland were able to take a more charitable
view of the past, and they became the keepers of those very
poems and laws and proverbs and Runic inscriptions which on
the continent had to be put down with inquisitorial cruelty.
The men to whom the collection of the ancient pagan poetry of
Iceland is commonly ascribed were men of Christian learning:
the one,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> the founder of a public school; the other,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> famous as
the author of a history of the North, the Heimskringla (the
Home-Circle—the World). It is owing to their labors that we
know anything of the ancient religion, the traditions, the maxims,
the habits of the Norsemen. Dr. Dasent dwells most fully
on the religious system of Iceland, which is the same, at least
in its general outline, as that believed in by all the members of
the Teutonic family, and may truly be called one of the various
dialects of the primitive religious and mythological language of
the Aryan race. There is nothing more interesting than religion
in the whole history of man. By its side, poetry and art,
science and law, sink into comparative insignificance.</p>

  <h3 id='chap0-3' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. <br /> NORSE MYTHOLOGY COMPARED WITH THE GREEK.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Dr. Dasent says the Norse mythology may hold
its own against any other in the world. The fact
that it is the religion of our forefathers ought to be
enough to commend it to our attention; but it may be
pardonable in us to harbor even a sense of pride, if we
find, for instance, that the mythology of our Gothic
ancestors suffers nothing, but rather is the gainer in
many respects by a comparison with that world-famed
paganism of the ancient Greeks. We would therefore
invite the attention of the reader to a brief comparison
between the Norse and Greek systems of mythology.</p>

<p class='c004'>A comparison between the two systems is both interesting
and important. They are the two grandest systems
of cosmogony and theogony of which we have
record, but the reader will generously pardon the writer
if he ventures the statement already at the outset, that
of the two the Norse system is the grander. These two,
the Greek and the Norse, have, to a greater extent than
all other systems of mythology combined, influenced the
civilization, determined the destinies, socially and politically,
of the European nations, and shaped their polite
literature. In literature it might indeed seem that the
Greek mythology has played a more important part.
We admit that it has acted a more <i>conspicuous</i> part, but
we imagine that there exists a wonderful blindness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>among many writers, to the transcendent influence of
the blood and spirit of ancient Norseland on North
European, including English and American, character,
which character has in turn stamped itself upon our
literature (as, for instance, in the case of Shakespeare,
the Thor among all Teutonic writers); and, furthermore,
we rejoice in the absolute certainty to which we have
arrived by studying the signs of the times, that the comparative
ignorance, which has prevailed in this country
and in England, of the history, literature, ancient religion
and institutions of a people so closely allied to us by
race, national characteristics, and tone of mind as the
Norsemen, will sooner or later be removed; that a school
of Norse philology and antiquities will ere long flourish
on the soil of the Vinland of our ancestors, and that there
is a grand future, not far hence, when Norse mythology
will be copiously reflected in our elegant literature, and
in our fine arts, painting, sculpturing and music.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Norse mythology differs widely from the Greek.
They are the same in essence; that is to say, both are a
recognition of the forces and phenomena of nature as
gods and demons; but all mythologies are the same in
this respect, and the differences, between the various
mythological systems, consist in the different ways in
which nature has impressed different peoples, and in the
different manner in which they have comprehended the
universe, and personified or deified the various forces
and phenomena of nature. In other words, it is in the
ethical clothing and elaboration of the myths, that the
different systems of mythology differ one from the other.
In the Vedic and Homeric poets the germs of mythology
are the same as in the Eddas of Norseland, but this
common stock of materials, that is, the forces and phenomena
of nature, has been moulded into an infinite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>variety of shapes by the story-tellers of the Hindoos,
Greeks and Norsemen.</p>

<p class='c004'>Memory among the Greeks is <i>Mnemosyne</i>, the mother
of the muses, while among the Norsemen it is represented
by Munin, one of the ravens perched upon Odin’s
shoulders. The masculine Heimdal, god of the rainbow
among the Norsemen, we find in Greece as the feminine
Iris, who charged the clouds with water from the lakes
and rivers, in order that it might fall again upon the
earth in gentle fertilizing showers. She was daughter
of Thaumas and Elektra, granddaughter of Okeanos,
and the swift-footed gold-winged messenger of the gods.
The Norse Balder is the Greek Adonis. Frigg, the
mother of Balder, mourns the death of her son, while
Aphrodite sorrows for her special favorite, the young
rosy shepherd, Adonis. Her grief at his death, which
was caused by a wild boar, was so great that she would
not allow the lifeless body to be taken from her arms
until the gods consoled her by decreeing that her lover
might continue to live half the year, during the spring
and summer, on the earth, while she might spend the
other half with him in the lower world. Thus Balder and
Adonis are both summer gods, and Frigg and Aphrodite
are goddesses of gardens and flowers. The Norse god
of Thunder, Thor (Thursday), who, among the Norsemen,
is only the protector of heaven and earth, is the
Greek Zeus, the father of gods and men. The gods of
the Greeks are essentially free from decay and death.
They live forever on Olympos, eating ambrosial food and
drinking the nectar of immortality, while in their veins
flows not immortal blood, but the imperishable ichor.
In the Norse mythology, on the other hand, Odin himself
dies, and is swallowed by the Fenriswolf; Thor conquers
the Midgard-serpent, but retreats only nine paces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and falls poisoned by the serpent’s breath; and the body
of the good and beautiful Balder is consumed in the
flames of his funeral pile. The Greek dwelt in bright
and sunny lands, where the change from summer to
winter brought with it no feelings of overpowering
gloom. The outward nature exercised a cheering influence
upon him, making him happy, and this happiness
he exhibited in his mythology. The Greek cared less to
commune with the silent mountains, moaning winds,
and heaving sea; he spent his life to a great extent in
the cities, where his mind would become more interested
in human affairs, and where he could share his joys and
sorrows with his kinsmen. While the Greek thus was
brought up to the artificial society of the town, the
hardy Norseman was inured to the rugged independence
of the country. While the life and the nature surrounding
it, in the South, would naturally have a tendency to
make the Greek more human, or rather to deify that
which is human, the popular life and nature in the
North would have a tendency to form in the minds of
the Norsemen a sublimer and profounder conception of
the universe. The Greek clings with tenacity to the
beautiful earth; the earth is his mother. Zeus, surrounded
by his gods and goddesses, sits on his golden
throne, on Olympos, on the top of the mountain, in the
cloud. But that is not lofty enough for the spirit of
the Norsemen. Odin’s Valhal is in heaven; nay, Odin
himself is not the highest god; Muspelheim is situated
above Asaheim, and in Muspelheim is Gimle, where
reigns a god, who is mightier than Odin, the god whom
Hyndla ventures not to name.</p>

<p class='c004'>In <i>Heroes and Hero Worship</i>, Thomas Carlyle makes
the following striking comparison between Norse and
Greek mythology: To me, he says, there is in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Norse system something very genuine, very great and
manlike. A broad simplicity, rusticity, so very different
from the light gracefulness of the old Greek paganism,
distinguishes this Norse system. It is <i>thought</i>, the genuine
thought of deep, rude, earnest minds, fairly opened
to the things about them, a face-to-face and heart-to-heart
inspection of things—the first characteristic of all
good thought in all times. Not graceful lightness, half
sport, as in the Greek paganism; a certain homely
truthfulness and rustic strength, a great rude sincerity,
discloses itself here. Thus Carlyle.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the visible workings of nature are in the great
and main features the same everywhere; in all climes
we find the vaulted sky with its sun, moon, myriad
stars and flitting clouds; the sea with its surging billows;
the land with its manifold species of plants and
animals, its elevations and depressions; we find cold,
heat, rain, winds, etc., although all these may vary widely
in color, brilliancy, depth, height, degree, and other qualities;
and as the minds and hearts of men cherish hope,
fear, anxiety, passion, etc., although they may be influenced
and actuated by them in various ways and to
various extents; and as mythology is the impersonation
of nature’s forces and phenomena as contemplated by the
human mind and <i>heart</i>, so all mythologies, no matter
in what clime they originated and were fostered, must
of necessity have their stock of materials, their ground-work
or foundation and frame in common, while they
may differ widely from each other in respect to peculiar
characteristics, both in the ethical elaboration of the
myth and in the architectural effect of the <i>tout ensemble</i>.
Thus we have a tradition about a deluge, for instance,
in nearly every country on the globe, but no two nations
tell it alike. In Genesis we read of Noah and his ark,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and how the waters increased greatly upon the earth,
destroying all flesh that moved upon the earth excepting
those who were with him in the ark. In Greece,
Deukalion and his wife Pyrrha become the founders of
a new race of men. According to the Greek story, a great
flood had swept away the whole human race, except
one pair, Deukalion and Pyrrha, who, as the flood
abated, landed on <abbr title='mount'>Mt.</abbr> Parnassos, and thence descending,
picked up stones and cast them round about, as
Zeus had commanded. From these stones sprung a new
race—men from those cast by Deukalion, and women
from those cast by his wife. In Norseland, Odin and
his two brothers, Vile and Ve, slew the giant Ymer, and
when he fell, so much blood flowed from his wounds,
that the whole race of frost-giants was drowned, except
a single giant, who saved himself with his household
in a skiff (ark), and from him descended a new race of
frost-giants. Now this is not a tradition carried from
one place to the other; it is a natural expression of the
same thought; it is a similar effort to account for the
origin of the land and the race of man. A people develops
its mythology in the same manner as it develops its
language. The Norse mythology is related to the Greek
mythology to the same extent that the Norse language
is related to the Greek language, and no more; and
comparative mythology, when the scholar wields the
pen, is as interesting as comparative philology.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Greeks have their chaos, the all-embracing space,
the Norsemen have Ginungagap, the yawning abyss
between Niflheim (the nebulous world) and Muspelheim
(the world of fire). The Greeks have their titans, corresponding
in many respects to the Norse giants. The
Greeks tell of the Melian nymphs; the Norsemen of
the elves, etc.; but these comparisons are chiefly interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>for the purpose of studying the differences between
the Norse and Greek <i>mind</i>, which reflects itself in the
expression of the thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hard stone weeps tears, both in Greece and in
Norseland; but let us notice how differently it is
expressed. In Greece, Niobe, robbed of her children,
was transformed into a rugged rock, down which tears
trickled silently. She becomes a stone and still continues
her weeping—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Et lacrymas etiamnum marmora manant,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>as the poet somewhere has it. In Norseland all nature
laments the sad death of Balder, even the stones weep
for him (gráta Baldr).</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us take another idea, and notice how differently
the words symbolize the same truth or thought in
the Bible, in Greece, and in Norseland. In the Bible:</p>

<p class='c010'>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how
people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich
cast in much. And there came a certain poor widow, and she
threw in two mites, which make a farthing. And he called unto
him his disciples and said unto them, Verily I say unto you,
that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which
have cast into the treasury: for all they did cast in of their
abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had,
even all her living.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Greece:</p>

<p class='c010'>A rich Thessalian offered to the temple at Delphi one
hundred oxen with golden horns. A poor citizen from Hermion
took as much meal from his sack as he could hold between two
fingers, and he threw it into the fire that burned on the altar.
Pythia said, that the gift of the poor man was more pleasing to
the gods than that of the rich Thessalian.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Norseland the Elder Edda has it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Knowest thou how to pray?</div>
      <div class='line'>Knowest thou how to offer?</div>
      <div class='line'>Better not pray at all</div>
      <div class='line'>Than to offer too much,</div>
      <div class='line'>Better is nothing sent</div>
      <div class='line'>Than too much consumed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In these few and simple words are couched the
same thought as in the Jewish and Greek accounts just
given. It is this identity in thought, with diversity
of depth, breadth, beauty, simplicity, etc., in the expression
or symbol that characterizes the differences between
all mythological systems. Each has its own peculiarities
stamped upon it, and in these peculiarities the
spirit of the people, their tendency to thorough investigation
or superficiality, their strength or weakness, their
profoundness or frivolity, are reflected as in a mirror.</p>

<p class='c004'>The beauty of the Greek mythology consists not so
much in the system, considered as a whole, as in the
separate single groups of myths. Each group has its
own center around which it revolves, each group moves
in its own sphere, and there develops its own charming
perfection, without regard to the effect upon the system
of mythology considered as a whole. Each group is
exquisite, and furnishes an inexhaustible fountain of
legendary narrative, but the central thought that should
bind all these beautiful groups into one grand whole is
weak. Nay, the complex multiplicity into which it
constantly kept developing, as long as the Greek mind
was in vigorous activity, was the cause that finally shattered
it. Is not this the same spirit, which we find so
distinctly developed in the Greek mythology, this want
of a centralizing thought, most wonderfully and perfectly
reflected in the social and political characteristics
of the Greek states, and in all the more recent Romance
nations? Each Greek state developed a peculiar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>beauty and perfection of its own; but between the
different states (Sparta, Athens, etc.,) there was no
strong bond of union which could keep them together,
and hence all the feuds and civil wars and final dissolution.
In the Norse mythology, on the other hand,
the centralizing idea or thought is its peculiar feature;
in it lies its strength and beauty. In the Norse mythology,
the one myth and the one divinity is inextricably
in communion with the other; and thus, also,
the idea of unity, centralization, is a prominent feature,
and one of the chief characteristics of the Teutonic
nations. While the Greek mythology foreshadowed all
the petty states of Greece, as well as those of South
Europe and South America, the Norse mythology foreshadowed
the political and social destinies of <i>united</i>
Scandinavia, <i>united</i> Great Britain, <i>united</i> Germany, and
the <i>United</i> States of North America. When the Greeks
unite, they <i>fall</i>. We Northerners live only to be <i>united</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>As we would be led to suppose, from a study of the
physical and climatical peculiarities of Greece and
Norseland, we find that the Greek mythology forms an
epic poem, and that the Norse is a tragedy. Not only
the mythology, considered as a whole, but even the
character of its speech, and of its very words and
phrases, must necessarily be suggested and modified by
the external features of the country. Thus in Greece,
where the sun’s rays never scorch, and where the northern
winds never pierce, we naturally find in the speech
of the people, brilliancy rather than gloom, life rather
than decay, and constant renovation rather than prolonged
lethargy. But in the frozen-bound regions of
the North, where the long arms of the glaciers clutch
the valleys in their cold embrace, and the death-portending
avalanches cut their way down the mountain-sides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>the tongue of the people would, with a peculiar intensity
of feeling, dwell upon the tragedy of nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Danish poet Grundtvig expressed a similar idea
more than sixty years ago, when he said that the Asa-Faith
unfolds in five acts the most glorious drama of
victory that ever has been composed, or ever could be
composed, by any mortal poet. And Hauch defines
these five acts as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>Act <abbr title='1'>I</abbr>. The Creation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Act <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. The time preceding the death of Balder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Act <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. The death of Balder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Act <abbr title='4'>IV</abbr>. The time immediately succeeding the death of Balder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Act <abbr title='5'>V</abbr>. Ragnarok, the Twilight of the gods, that is, the decline
and fall immediately followed by the regeneration of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is an inestimable peculiarity of the Norse mythology,
that it, in addition to beginning with a theogony
(birth of the gods), also ends with a theoktony (death
of the gods). In the Greek mythology, the drama
lacks the fifth or final act, and we have only a prosaic
account of how the people at length grew tired of their
gods, and left them when they became old and feeble.
But the Eddas have a theoktonic myth, in which the
heroic death of the gods is sung with the same poetic
spirit as their youthful exploits and victories. As the
shades of night flee before the morning dawn, thus
Valhal’s gods had to sink into the earth, when the
idea, that an idol is of no consequence in this world,
first burst upon the minds of the idol-worshipers. This
idea spontaneously created the myth of Ragnarok. All
the elements of its mythical form were foreshadowed in
the older group of Norse conceptions. The idea of
Ragnarok was suggested already in the Creation; for
the gods are there represented as proceeding from giants,
that is, from an evil, chaotic source, and, moreover, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>which can be born must die. The Greeks did not
release the titans from their prisons in Tartaros and
bring them up to enter the last struggle with the gods.
Signs of such a contest flitted about like clouds in the
deep-blue southern sky, but they did not gather into a
deluging thunder-storm. The ideas were too broken
and scattered to be united into one grand picture.
The Greek was so much allured by the pleasures of
life, that he could find no time to fathom its depths
or rise above it. And hence, when the glories of this
life had vanished, there remained nothing but a vain
shadow, a lower world, where the pale ghosts of the
dead knew no greater happiness than to receive tidings
from this busy world.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Norseman willingly yields the prize to the Greek
when the question is of precision in details and external
adornment of the figures; but when we speak of deep
significance and intrinsic power, the Norseman points
quietly at Ragnarok, the Twilight of the gods, and
the Greek is silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Goth, as has before been indicated, concentrated
life; the Greek divided it into parcels. Thus the
Greek mythology is frivolous, the Norse is profound.
The frivolous mind lives but to enjoy the passing moment;
the profound mind reflects, considers the past
and the future. The Greek abandoned himself wholly
to the pleasures of this life, regardless of the past
or future. The Norseman accepted life as a good
gift, but he knew that he was merely its transient possessor.
Over every moment of life hangs a threatening
sword, which may in the next moment prove fatal.
Life possesses no hour of the future. And this is the
peculiar characteristic of the heroic life in the North,
that our ancestors were powerfully impressed with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>uncertainty of life. They constantly witnessed the
interchange of life and death, and this nourished in
them the thought that life is not worth keeping, for
no one knows how soon it may end. Life itself has
no value, but the object constantly to be held in view
is to die an honorable death. While we are permitted
to live, let us strive to die with honor, it is said in
Bjarkemaal; and in the lay of Hamder of the Elder
Edda we read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Well have we fought;</div>
      <div class='line'>On slaughtered Goths we stand,</div>
      <div class='line'>On those fallen by the sword,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like eagles on a branch.</div>
      <div class='line'>Great glory we have gained;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though now or to-morrow we shall die,—</div>
      <div class='line'>No one lives till eve</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the norns’ decree.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is this same conception of the problem of life
that in the Christian religion has assumed a diviner
form. Though his ideas were clothed in a ruder form,
the Norseman still reached the same depth of thought
as when the Christian says: I am ready to lay down
my life, if I may but die happy, die a child of God;
for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole
world, and lose his own soul?</p>

<p class='c004'>The Norseman always concentrated his ideas as much
as possible. For this reason he knew but three sins—perjury,
murder, and adultery; that is, sin against God,
sin against the state, and sin against fellow-man; and
all these are in fact but one sin—deceitfulness. In
the same manner the Norseman concentrated his ideas
in regard to the punishment of sin. When the Eddas
tell us about the punishment of the wicked, they sum
it all up in Naastrand (the strand of corpses), that place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>far from the sun, that large and terrible cave, the doors
of which open to the north. This cave is built of
serpents wattled together, and the heads of all the serpents
turn into the cave, filling it with streams of
poison, in which perjurers, murderers and adulterers
have to wade. The suffering is terrible; gory hearts
hang outside of their breasts; their faces are dyed in
blood; strong venom-dragons fiercely run through their
hearts; their hands are riveted together with ever-burning
stones; their clothes a wrapped in flames;
remorseless ravens tear their eyes from their heads:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But all the horrors</div>
      <div class='line'>You cannot know,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Hel’s condemned endure;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet sins there</div>
      <div class='line'>Bitterly are punished,</div>
      <div class='line'>False pleasures</div>
      <div class='line'>Reap true pain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The point to be observed is, that all the punishment
here described is the same for all the wicked.</p>

<p class='c004'>But with this, the versatile Greek is not content.
He multiplies the sins and the punishments. Tartaros
is full of despair and tears, and the wicked there suffer
a variety of tortures. Enormous vultures continually
gnaw the liver of Tityos, but it always grows again.
Ixion is lashed with serpents to a wheel, which a
strong wind drives continually round and round. Tantalos
suffers from an unceasing dread of being crushed
by a great rock that hangs over his head; he stands in
a stream of water that flows up to his throat, and he
almost perishes from thirst; whenever he bends his
head to drink the water recedes; delicious fruits hang
over his head, whenever he stretches out his hand they
evade his grasp. Thus it is to be <i>tantalized</i>. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Danaïdes must fill a cistern that has holes in the bottom;
all the water they pour in runs out equally fast.
Sisyphos, sweating and all out of breath, rolls his huge
stone up the mountain side; when he reaches the summit,
the stone rolls down again.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fundamental idea is always the same. It is
always punishment for sin; but it is expressed and
illustrated in many different ways. The variety
enhances the beauty. The Greek mythology is rich,
for profuseness of illustration is wealth. The Norse
mythology is poor, because it is so strong; it consumes
all its strength in the profoundness of its thought.
The Norse mythology excels in the concentratedness
and strength of the whole system; the Greek excels in
the beauty of the separate groups of myths. The one
is a religion of <i>strength</i>, the other of <i>beauty</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The influence that the outward features of a country
exercise upon the thoughts and feelings of men,
especially during the vigorous, imaginative, poetic and
prophetic childhood of a nation, can hardly be overestimated.
Necessarily, therefore, do we find this influence
affecting and modifying a nation’s mythology,
which is a child-like people’s thoughts and feelings,
contemplating nature reflected in a system of religion.
Hence, it is eminently fitting, in comparing the Norse
mythology with the Greek, to take a look at the home
of the Norsemen. We, therefore, cordially invite the
traveler from the smooth-beaten tracks of southern Europe
to the mountains, lakes, valleys and fjords of
Norseland. You may come in midsummer, when Balder
(the summer sunlight) rules supreme, when the
radiant dawn and glowing sunset kiss each other and
go hand in hand on the mountain tops; but we would
also invite you to tarry until Balder is slain, when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>wintry gloom, with its long nights, sits brooding over
the country, and Loke (Thok, fire) weeps his arid tears
(sparks) over the desolation he has wrought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Norway is dark, cloudy, severe, grand, and majestic.
Greece is light, variegated, mild, and beautiful. No one
can long more deeply for the light of summer, with its
mild and gentle breezes from the south, than the Norseman.
When he has pondered on his own thoughts during
the long winter, when the sun entirely or nearly
disappeared from above the horizon, and nothing but
northern lights flickered and painted the colors of the
rainbow over his head, he welcomes the spring sun with
enthusiastic delight. It was this deep longing for Balder
that drove swarms of Norsemen on viking expeditions
to France, Spain, and England; through the pillars of
Hercules to Italy, Greece, Constantinople and Palestine,
and over the surging main to Iceland, Greenland and
Vinland. It is this deep longing for Balder that every
year brings thousands of Norsemen to alight upon our
shores and scatter themselves to their numberless settlements
in these United States. Still every Norse emigrant,
if he has aught in him worthy of his race,
thinks he shall once more see those weird, gigantic,
snow-capped mountains, that stretched their tall heads
far above the clouds and seemed to look half anxiously,
half angrily after him as his bark was floating across
the deep sea.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is something in the natural scenery of Norway—a
peculiar blending of the grand, the picturesque,
the gigantic, bewildering and majestic. There is something
that leaves you in bewildering amazement, when
you have seen it, and makes you ask yourself, Was it
real or was it only a dream? Norway is in fact one
huge imposing rock, and its valleys are but great clefts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>in it. Through these clefts the rivers, fed by vast glaciers
upon the mountains, find their way to the sea.
They come from the distance, now musically and chattingly
meandering their way beneath the willows, now
tumbling down the slopes, reeking and distorted by the
rocks that oppose them, until they reach some awful
precipice and tumble down some eight hundred to a
thousand feet in a single leap into the depths below,
where no human being ever yet set his foot. We are
not overdrawing the picture. You cannot get to the
foot of such falls as the Voring Force or Rjukan Force,
but you may look over the precipice from above and see
the waters pouring like fine and fleecy wool into the
seething caldron, where you can discern through the
vapory mists shoots of foam at the bottom, like rockets
of water, radiating in every direction. You hear a low
rumbling sound around you, and the very rock vibrates
beneath your feet; and as you hang half giddy over
the cliff, clasping your arms around some young birch-tree
that tremblingly leans over the brink of the steep,
and turn your eyes to the huge mountain mass that
breasts you,—its black, melancholy sides seemingly
within a stone’s throw, and its snow-white head far in
the clouds above,—your thoughts involuntarily turn to
<i>him</i>, the God, whom the skald dare not name, to <i>him</i>
at whose bidding Gausta Fjeld and Reeking Force
sprang from Ginungagap, from the body of the giant
Ymer, from chaos. You look longer upon this wonderful
scene, and you begin to think of Ragnarok, of
the Twilight of the gods. Once seen, and the grand
picture, which defies the brush of the painter, will forever
afterwards float before your mind like a dream.</p>

<p class='c004'>Make a journey by steamer on some of those noble
and magnificent fjords on the west coast of Norseland.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>The whole scenery looks like a moving panorama of
the finest description. The dark mountains rise almost
perpendicularly from the water’s edge to an enormous
height; their summits, crowned with ice and snow, stand
out sharp and clear against the bright blue sky; and
the ravines on the mountain tops are filled with huge
glaciers, that clasp their frosty arms around the valley,
and send down, like streams of tears along the weather-beaten
cheeks of the mountains, numerous waterfalls and
cascades, falling in an endless variety of graceful shapes
from various altitudes into the fjord below. Sometimes
a solitary peak lifts its lordly head a thousand feet
clear above the surrounding mountains, and towering
like a monarch over all, it defiantly refuses to hold communion
with any living thing save the eagle. Here and
there a force appears, like a strip of silvery fleecy cloud,
suspended from the brow of the mountain, and dashing
down more than two thousand feet in one leap; and all
this marvelously grand scenery, from base to peak,
stands reflected, as deep as it is lofty, in the calm, clear,
sea-green water of the fjord, perfect as in a mirror.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is no storm; the deep water of the fjord is
silent and at rest. Not even the flight of a single bird
ruffles its glassy surface. As the steamer glides gently
along between the rocky walls, you hear no sound save
the monotonous throbbing of the screw and the consequent
splashing of the water. All else is still as death.
The forces hang in silence all around, occasionally
overarched by rainbows suspended in the rising mist.
The naked mountains have a sombre look, that would
make you melancholy were it not for the overpowering
grandeur. Sunshine reaches the water only when the
sun’s rays fall nearly vertically, in consequence of the
immense height of the mountains’ sides, whose enormous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>shadows almost perpetually overshade the narrow
fjord. The noonday sun paints a streak of delicate
palish green on one side, forming a striking contrast
to the other dark overshadowed side of the profound
fjord. It is awe-inspiring. It is stupendous. It is solemnly
grand. You can but fancy yourself in a fairy
land, with elves and sprites and neckens and trolls
dancing in sportive glee all around you.</p>

<p class='c004'>Words can paint no adequate picture of the stupendousness,
majesty and grandeur of Norse scenery;
but can the reader wonder any longer that this country
has given to the world such marvelous productions
in poetry, music and the fine arts? Nay, what is more
to our purpose at present, would you not look for a grand
and marvelous mythological system from the poetic and
imaginative childhood of the nation that inhabits this
land? Knock, and it shall be opened unto you! and
entering the solemn halls and palaces of the gods,
where all is cordiality and purity, you will find there
perfectly reflected the wild and tumultuous conflict of
the elements, strong rustic pictures, full of earnest and
deep thought, awe-inspiring and wonderful. You will
find that simple and martial religion which inspired
the early Norsemen and developed them like a tree full
of vigor extending long branches over all Europe. You
will find that simple and martial religion which gave
the Norsemen that restless unconquerable spirit, apt to
take fire at the very mention of subjection and constraint;
that religion which forged the instruments
that broke the fetters manufactured by the Roman
emperors, destroyed tyrants and slaves, and taught
men that nature having made all free and equal, no
other reason but their mutual happiness could be
assigned for making them dependent. You will find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>that simple and martial religion which was cherished
by those vast multitudes which, as Milton says, the
populous North</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——poured from her frozen loins to pass</div>
      <div class='line'>Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons</div>
      <div class='line'>Came like a deluge on the South and spread</div>
      <div class='line'>Beneath Gibraltar and the Libyan sands.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But it may be necessary for the reader to refresh himself
with a few draughts of that excellent beverage kept
in Minter’s gushing fountain, and drink with <i>his</i> glittering
horn, before he will be willing to accept these
and many more such statements that we will make in
thee course of this introduction.</p>

<p class='c004'>To return to our theme. The gods of Norseland
are stern and awe-inspiring; those of Greece are gentle
and lovely. In the Norse mythology we find deep devotion,
but seldom tears. In the Greek, there are violent
emotions and the fears flow copiously. In Norseland,
there is plenty of imagination; but it is not of that
light, variegated, butterfly, soap-bubble nature as in
Greece. In the Norse mythology there is plenty of cordiality
and sincerity, and the gods treat you hospitably
to flesh of the boar, Sæhrimner; and the valkyries will
give you deep draughts from bowls flowing with ale.
In Greece there is gracefulness, a perfect etiquette, and
you dine on ambrosia and nectar; there Eros and Psyche,
the graces and muses, hover about you like heavenly
cherubs. Graces and muses are wanting in Norseland.
The Norse mythology is characterized throughout by a
deep and genuine sincerity; the Greek, on the other
hand, by a sublime gracefulness; but, with Carlyle, we
think that sincerity is better than grace.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the comparison between Norse and Greek
mythology is too vast a field for us to attempt to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>justice to it in this volume. It would be an interesting
work to show how Norse and Greek mythologies
respectively have colored the religious, social, political
and literary character of Greek and Romance peoples
on the one hand, and Norsemen and Teutons on the
other. Somebody will undoubtedly in due time be
inspired to undertake such a task. We must study
both, and when they are harmoniously blended in our
nature, we must let them together shape our political,
social and literary destinies, and, tempered by the
Mosaic-Christian religion, they may be entitled to some
consideration even in our religious life.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
  <h3 id='chap0-4' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='4'>IV</abbr>. <br /> ROMAN MYTHOLOGY.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In all that has been said up to this time Roman
mythology has not once been mentioned. Why
not? Properly speaking, there is no such thing. It
is an historical fact, that nearly the whole Roman
literature, especially that part of it which may be called
<i>belles-lettres</i>, is scarcely anything but imitation. It
did not, like the Greek and Old Norse, spring from the
popular mind, by which it was cherished through
centuries; but at least a large portion of it was
produced for pay and for ornament, mostly in the time
of the tyrant Augustus, to tickle his ear and gild those
chains that were artfully forged to fetter the peoples of
southern Europe. This is a dry but stubborn truth,
and it is wonderful with what tenacity the schools in
all civilized lands have clung to the Roman or Latin
language, after it had become nothing but a
corpse; as though it could be expected that any
genuine culture could be derived from this dead
monster.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is, however, an encouraging fact that the Teutonic
races are indicating a tendency to emancipate themselves
from the fetters of Roman bondage, and happy
should we be if our English words were emancipated
therefrom. We should then use neither <i>emancipate</i>, nor
<i>tendency</i>, nor <i>indicate</i>, but would have enough of
Gothic words to use in place of them. Ay, the signs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of the times are encouraging. Look at what is being
done at Oxford and Cambridge, in London and in
Edinburgh. Behold what has been done during these
later years by Dasent, Samuel Laing, Thorpe, Carlyle,
Max Müller, Cleasby, Vigfusson, Magnússon, Morris,
Hjaltalin, and others. And look at the publications of
the Clarendon press, which is now publishing Icelandic
Sagas in the original text. This is right. Every
scrap of Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon literature must
be published, for we must see what those old heroes,
who crushed Rome and instituted a new order of
things, thought in every direction. We must find out
what their aspirations were. To the credit of the
Scandinavians it must here be said, that they began to
appreciate their old Icelandic literature much sooner
than the rich Englishman realized the value of the
Anglo-Saxon, and that the English are indebted to
Rasmus Rask, the Danish scholar, for the most valuable
contribution to Anglo-Saxon studies; but it must also
be admitted, in the first place, that the Scandinavians
have done far too little for Icelandic, and, in the next
place, that without a preparation in Icelandic, but little
progress could be made in the study of Anglo-Saxon.
But England, with its usual liberality in literary
matters, is now rapidly making amends for the past.
And well she might. In the publication of the
Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon literature she is the greatest
gainer, for it is nothing less than a bridge, that will
unite her present and past history. Maurer and
Möbius are watching with Argos eyes the interests of
Teutonic studies in Germany.</p>

<p class='c004'>Greek should be studied, for that is no imitation.
It is indigenous. It is a crystal clear stream flowing
unadulterated from the Castalian fountain of Parnassos.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Our warfare, therefore, is not against Greek, but against
Latin. We have suffered long enough with our necks
under the ponderous Roman yoke in all its venous
forms; take it as fetters forged by the Roman emperors,
as crosiers in the hands of the Roman popes, or as
rods in the hands of the Roman school-masters. The
Goths severed the fetters of the Roman emperors,
Luther and the Germans broke the crosiers of the
Roman popes, but all the Teutons have submissively
kissed the rod of the Roman school-master, although
this was the most dangerous of the three: it was the
deadly weapon concealed in the hand of the assassin.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Romans were a people of robbers both in
political and in a literary sense. Nay, the Roman writers
themselves tell us that the divine founder of the
city, Romulus, was a captain of <i>robbers</i>; that <i>Mars</i>,
the god of <i>war</i>, was his father; and that a <i>wolf</i> (<i>rapacity</i>),
descending from the mountains to drink, ran at
the cry of the child and fed him under a fig-tree,
caressing and licking him as if he had been her own
son, the infant hanging on to her as if she had been
his mother. This Romulus began his great exploits by
<i>killing his own brother</i>. When the new city seemed
to want women, to insure its duration, he proclaimed
a magnificent feast throughout all the neighboring villages,
at which feast were presented, among other things,
the terrible shows of <i>gladiators</i>. While the strangers
were most intent upon the spectacle, a number of Roman
youths rushed in among the Sabines, <i>seized</i> the
youngest and fairest of their wives and daughters, and
carried them off by <i>violence</i>. In vain the parents and
husbands protested against this <i>breach of hospitality</i>.
This same Romulus ended his heroic career by being
<i>assassinated</i> by his friends, or, as others say, <i>torn in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>pieces</i> in the senate-house. Certain it is that the Romans
<i>murdered</i> him, and then declared him the guardian
spirit of the city; thus worshiping as a god, by
name Quirinus, him whom they could not bear as a
king. Such falsehoods as the one the senate invented,
when they said that Romulus, whom they had murdered,
had been taken up into heaven, the Roman
writers tell us were constantly taught to the Romans
by Numa Pompilius, and by other Sabine and Etrurian
priests; and such instruction laid the foundation of
their myths.  The history of Romulus is, in fact, in
miniature, the history of Rome.</p>

<p class='c004'>But in spite of this, and much else that can in justice
be said against Rome and Latin, we cannot afford to
throw the language and literature of the Romans entirely
overboard. Their history was too remarkable for
that; besides, many scribbled in Latin down through
the middle ages, and the Latin language has played so
conspicuous a part in English literature, and in the
sciences, that no educated man can very well do without
it. What we respectfully object to is making it
the foundation of all education, this <i>bringing the scholar
up</i>, so to speak, on Latin language, history and literature;
this nourishing and moulding the tender heart
and mind on <i>Roman thought</i>,—thus making the man,
intellectually and morally, a slave bound in Roman
chains, while we free-born Goths, the descendants of
Odin and Thor, ought to begin our education and
receive our first impressions from our own ancestors.
The tree should draw its nourishment from its own
roots; and we Americans are the youngest and most
vigorous branch of that glorious Gothic tree, the beautiful
and noble Ygdrasil in the Norse cosmogony, whose
three grand roots strike down among the Anglo-Saxons,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Scandinavians, and Germans. In order fully to comprehend
the man, we must study the life of the child;
and in order to comprehend ourselves as a people, we
must study our own ancient history and literature and
make ourselves thoroughly acquainted with the imaginative
and prophetic childhood of the Teutonic race.
We must give far more attention than we do, first, to
English and Anglo-Saxon, and we must, as we have
heard Dr. <abbr class='spell'>S. H.</abbr> Carpenter, of the University of Wisconsin
most truthfully remark, begin with the most
modern English, and then follow it step by step, century
by century, back to the most ancient Anglo-Saxon.
A <i>living</i> language can be learned ten times as fast as a
dead one, and we would apply Dr. Carpenter’s<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> principle
still further. We would make one of the living
Romantic languages (French, Italian, or Spanish,) a key
to the Latin; and above all, we would make modern
Greek a preparation for old classic Greek. It cannot
be controverted that children learn to read and write a
language much sooner and easier if they first learn to
speak it, even though the book-speech may differ considerably
from the dialect which the child learned from
his mother; ample evidence of which fact may be found
in the different counties of England and Scotland and
throughout the European countries.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the next place, that is, next after English and
Anglo-Saxon, we must study German, Mæso-Gothic and
the Scandinavian languages, and especially Icelandic,
which is the only <i>living</i> key to the history of the middle
ages, and to the Old Norse literature. It is the only
language now in use in an almost unchanged form,
through a knowledge of which we can read the literature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>of the middle ages. We must by no means forget
that we have Teutonic antiquities to which we stand
in an entirely different and far closer relation than we
do to Greece or Rome. And the Norsemen have an old
literature, which the scholar must of necessity be familiar
with in order to comprehend the history of the
middle ages.</p>

<p class='c004'>When we have thus done justice to our own Teutonic
race we may turn our attention to the ancient
peoples around the Mediterranean Sea, the most important
of which in literary and historical respects are the
Hebrews, Greeks and Romans. The antiquities of these
peoples will always form important departments in our
colleges and universities, and it is our duty to study
them; but they should not, as they still to a great
extent do, constitute the all-absorbing subject of our
attention, the <i>summa summarum</i>, the foundation and
superstructure of our education and culture.</p>

<p class='c004'>It has been argued by some that the Latin is
more terse than English; but did the reader ever reflect
that it takes about <i>sixty syllables</i> in Latin to express
all that we can say in English with <i>forty syllables</i>?
The large number of inflectional endings have also been
lauded as a point of superior excellence in the Latin;
but as a language <i>grows</i> and makes <i>progress</i>, it gradually
emancipates itself from the thraldom of inflection
and contents itself with the abstract, spiritual chain
that links the words together into sentences; and
did the reader ever run across this significant truth,
expressed by George <abbr class='spell'>P.</abbr> Marsh, who says that in
Latin you have to be able to analyse and parse a
sentence before you can comprehend it, while in English
you must comprehend the sentence before you
can analyse or parse? <i>Forward</i> has been and will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>forever be the watchword of languages. They must
either progress or die.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the question is asked, whether Hebrew, Greek
or Latin should be preferred by the student, we
answer that the choice is not a difficult one to make,
and our opinion has in fact already been given. Latin
is the language of a race of robbers; most of it is
nothing but imitation, and besides it is a mere corpse,
while Greek is the only one of the three that is
still living, and modern Greek—for that is what we
must begin with—is the key to the old Greek literature
with its rich, beautiful and original store of mythology,
poetry, history, oratory, and philosophy. As
Icelandic in the extreme north of Europe is the <i>living</i>
key to the middle ages and to the celebrated Old
Norse Eddas and Sagas, so modern Greek in the far
south is the <i>living</i> language, that introduces us to the
spirit of Homer, Herodotus, Demosthenes, and Plato;
and thus the norns or fates, who preside over the
destinies of men and nations, have in a most wonderful
manner knit, or rather woven, us together with
the Greeks, and the more we investigate the development
and progress of nations and civilization, the
more vividly the truth will flash upon our minds,
that the Greek and the Icelandic are two silver-haired
veterans, who hold in their hands two golden keys,—the
one to unlock the treasures of ancient times, the
other those of the middle ages; the one the treasures
of the south and the other those of the north of
Europe. But we must free ourselves from the bondage
of Rome!</p>

<p class='c004'>When we get away from Rome, where slaves were
employed as teachers, and pay more attention to the
antiquities of Greece, where it was the highest honor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>that the greatest, noblest and most eloquent men could
attain to, to be listened to by youths eager to learn
and to be taught, then the present slavery both of the
teacher and of the student will cease, but scarcely before
then.</p>

<p class='c004'>The case of Shakespeare is an eminent example to us
of what the Goth is able to accomplish, when he breaks
the Roman chains. His works are not an imitation of
Seneca or Æschylus, nor are they the fruit of a careful
study of the <i>Ars Poetica</i> or <i>Gradus ad Parnassum</i>. No,
he knew but little Latin and less Greek, but what made
him the undisputed Hercules in English literature was
the heroic spirit of Gothdom which flowed in his veins,
and which drove him away from the Latin school before
his emotional nature had been flogged and tortured out
of him. Shakespeare, and not Roman literature and
scholasticism, is the lever that has raised English literature
and given it the first rank among all the Teutons.
It is not, we repeat, the deluge of Latin words that flood
it, that has given this preëminence to English, but it is
the genuine Gothic strength that everywhere has tried to
break down the Roman walls. The slaves of Latin will
find it difficult enough to explain how Shakespeare, who
was not for an age, but for all time,—he whose Latin was
small and whose Greek was less,—how he, the star of
poets, the sweet swan of Avon, was <i>made</i> as well as born.
Ay, he was made. <i>He</i> was also one of those who, to cast
a living line had to sweat, and strike the second heat upon
the Muses’ anvil. It is true that Shakespeare did not
arrive at a full appreciation of the Gothic spirit, for he
did not have an opportunity to acquaint himself thoroughly
with the Gothic myths; but then they ever
haunted him like the ghost of Hamlet, accusing their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>murderer, without finding any avenger. We therefore
count Shakespeare on our side of this great question.</p>

<p class='c004'>May the time speedily come, nay, the time must come,
when Greek and Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse and Gothic
and German will shake hands over the bloody chasm of
Roman vandalism!</p>

<p class='c004'>We fancy we see more than one who reads this chapter,
and does not remember that he is a son of Thor,
stretch out his hand for Mjolner, that huge and mighty
hammer of Thor, to swing it at us for what we have said
and have not said about Rome, Roman mythology, and
the Latin language and literature; but, alas! for him,
and fortunately for us, the Roman school-master took
Thor’s hammer away from him and whipped the strength
wherewith to wield it out of him. We only repeat that
we know nothing of Roman mythology, but the Greek
and Norse are twin sisters, and with the assistance of the
Mosaic-Christian religion they have a grand mission in
the Gothic-Greek development of the world.</p>

  <h3 id='chap0-5' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='5'>V</abbr>. <br /> INTERPRETATION OF NORSE MYTHOLOGY.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Considerable has been said on this subject in
the preceding pages, and the interpretation which
will be adhered to in this volume has been clearly indicated.
We propose now to give a general synopsis of
the more prominent methods of interpreting Norse mythology.</p>

<p class='c004'>In one thing all undoubtedly agree, namely, that
all mythologies embody religious faith. As we,
to this day, each in his own way, seek to find God by
philosophical speculation (natural theology), by our emotions,
by good deeds, or by all these at one time; and
as we, when we have found him, rest upon his breast,
although we do not fully agree as to our conception of
him, each one of us having his own God as each has
his own rainbow; thus our forefathers sought God everywhere—in
the rocks, in the babbling stream, in the
heavy ear of grain, in the star-strewn sky of night, and
in the splendor of the sun. It was revelations of
divinity that they looked for.  The fundamental element
in their mythology was a religious one, and this fact
must never be lost sight of. To interpret a myth,
then, is not only to give its source, but also its aim
and object, together with the thoughts and feelings
that it awakens in the human breast.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some writers (William and Mary Howitt and others)
maintain that the Norse mythology is a degradation of,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>or aberration from, the <i>true religion</i>, which was revealed
to man in the earliest period of the history of the human
race and is found pure and undefiled in the Bible;
that it presents sparkling waters from the original fountain
of tradition. They point with seriousness to it as
something that bears us on toward the primal period
of one tongue and one religion. In reference to the
Elder Edda, they say that it descended through vast
ages, growing, like all traditions, continually darker,
and accumulating lower matter and more divergent and
more pagan doctrines, as the walls of old castles become
covered with mosses and lichens, till it finally assumed
the form it which it was collected from the mouths
of the people, and put in a permanent written form.
These interpreters claim that through all mythologies
there run certain great lines, which converge toward
one common center and point to an original source of
a religious faith, which has grown dimmer and more
disfigured, the further it has gone. The geographical
center, they say, from which all these systems of heathen
belief have proceeded is the same—Central Asia; they
point to the eastern origin of the Norseman; they assert,
with full confidence, that the religious creed of the Norseman
is the faith of Persia, India, Greece, and every other
country, transferred to the snow-capped mountains of
Norway and jokuls of Iceland, having only been modified
there, so as to give it an air of originality without destroying
its primeval features. They argue that Loke
of the Norsemen, Pluto of the Greeks, Ahriman of the
Persians, Siva of the Hindoos, etc., are all originally the
devil of the Bible, who has changed his name and more
or less his personal form and characteristics. The
biblical Trinity is degenerated into the threefold trinity
of Odin, Vile, and Ve; Odin, Hœner, and Loder; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Odin, Thor, and Balder. They find in the Norse cosmogony,
in a somewhat mutilated and interpolated condition,
the Scripture theory of the creation, preservation,
destruction and regeneration of the world. Ygdrasil
is the tree of life in the garden of Eden; Ask and
Embla, the first human pair, are Adam and Eve; the
blood of the slain giant Ymer, in which the whole race
of frost-giants was drowned, (excepting one pair, who
were saved, and from whom a new giant race descended,)
is the flood of Noah, the deluge; the citadel called Midgard
is the tower of Babel; in the death of Balder, by
Hoder, who was instigated by Loke, they find the crucifixion
of Christ by Judas, instigated by the devil, etc.;
displaying a vast amount of erudition, profoundness and
ingenuity, that might have been applied to some good
purpose. We refrain from giving more of the results
of their learned and erudite investigations, from fear
of seducing ourselves or our readers into the adoption
of their absurdities.</p>

<p class='c004'>Other scholars (Snorre Sturleson, Saxo Grammaticus,
Suhm, Rask, and others,) give us what is called an <i>historical</i>
interpretation, asserting that Odin, Thor, Balder,
and the other deities that figure in the Norse mythology,
are veritable ancestors of the Norsemen,—men and
women who have lived in the remote past; and as distance
lends enchantment to the view, so the ordinary
kings and priests of pre-historic times have been magnified
into gods. Odin and the other divinities are in Snorre
Sturleson’s Heimskringla represented as having come to
Norseland from the great Svithiod, a country lying between
the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. According to
the historical interpretation the mythical worlds are real
countries that can be pointed out on the map. This was
the prevailing view taken during the last two centuries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and even that sagacious scholar of the earlier part of this century,
Professor Rasmus Rask, adheres almost exclusively
to the historical interpretation.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is curious to read these old authors and observe
how sincerely they have looked upon Odin as an extraordinary
and enterprising person who formerly ruled in
the North and inaugurated great changes in the government,
customs and religion of Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark. They speak of the great authority which he
enjoyed, and how he even had divine honors paid to him.
They ingeniously connect Odin with the Roman Commonwealth,
with Mithridates and Pompey (see <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_232'>232</a>).
This historical sketch of Odin will be given in connection
with the Odinic myth; suffice it here to say that the
king of Pontus and all his barbarian allies were obliged
to yield to the genius of Pompey. And here it is said
that Odin was one of the number defeated by Pompey.
He was obliged to withdraw himself by flight from the
vengeance of the Romans! Odin came to Norway by way
of Holstein and Jutland. On his way through Denmark
he founded the city Odinse, and placed his son Skjold
upon the Danish throne. How profound! What erudition!
How much like the enthusiastic work of the
Swede Rudbeck, who makes out the Atlantis of Plato to
be Sweden, and shows that Japhet, son of Noah, came
there and settled with his family! What profound learning
(<i>gelahrtheit</i>) these men must have possessed! We are
amazed and confounded at the vast amount of mental
force that has been brought into activity, at the untiring
zeal and the marvelous ingenuity, with which these theories
have been set up; but we cannot witness all this
without a feeling of deep regret that so much erudition
and ingenuity, so much mental strength, was so fruitlessly
thrown away. They were generally profound <i>Latin</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>scholars, and wrote the most of their books in Latin; but
those ponderous tomes make their authors fools in folios
in the light of modern historical knowledge. They studied
by that kind of lamp that illuminates a small spot on the
table, but leaves the whole room dark. A more careful
and enlightened study of our early literature has of course
given the death-blow to so prosaic an interpretation of the
Norse mythology as the purely historical one is.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then we are met by the so-called <i>ethical</i> interpretation
of mythology, seeking its origin in man’s peculiar nature,
especially in a moral point of view. The advocates of
this theory claim that mythology is a mere fiction created
to satisfy man’s spiritual, moral, and emotional nature.
The gods according to this interpretation represent man’s
virtues and vices, emotions, faculties of mind and muscle,
etc., personified. Odin, they say, is wisdom; Balder is
goodness; Thor is strength; Heimdal is grace, etc.
Again: Thor is the impersonation of strength and courage;
the giants represent impotent sloth and arrogance;
the conflicts between Thor and the giants are a struggle
going on in the human breast. And again: the mischief-maker
Loke instigated the blind Hoder to kill the good
Balder; Nanna, Balder’s wife, took her husband’s death
so much to heart, that she died of grief; Hoder is afterwards
slain by Odin’s son Vale; all nature weeps for Balder,
but still he is not released from Hel (hell). That is,
physical strength with its blind earthly desires (Hoder),
guided by sin (Loke), unconsciously kills innocence,
(Balder). Love (Nanna) dies broken-hearted; reflection
(Vale) is aroused and subdues physical strength (Hoder);
but innocence (Balder) has vanished from the world to
remain in Hel’s regions until the earth is regenerated,
after Ragnarok. The ethical interpretation makes the
gods the faculties of the spirit, and the giants the faculties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>of the body, in man; and between the two, soul and
body, there is a constant struggle for supremacy. This
interpretation is very good, because it is very <i>poetic</i>, but
it has more to do with the application of the myths than
with their primary source.</p>

<p class='c004'>Finally, an interpretation, that has frequently been
alluded to in the preceding pages of this introduction, is
the <i>physical</i>, or interpretation from nature,—impersonation
of the visible workings of nature. The divinities
are the forces and phenomena of nature personified; and
evidence of the correctness of this view can be abundantly
presented by defining etymologically names of the
several divinities, their attributes, dwellings and achievements,
and by showing how faithfully the works of
the gods correspond with the events and scenes of the
outward world. There is no doubt that this is the
true interpretation of all mythologies; and that it is,
so to speak, the key to the Norse mythology, it is
hoped will be sufficiently demonstrated in the second
part of this book in connection with the myths themselves;
but the ethical, or perhaps better the spiritual,
interpretation must by all means be added. The spiritual
or ethical and the physical interpretation must
be combined. In other words, we can scarcely make
the interpretation too <i>anthropomorphic</i>. The phenomena
and forces of nature have been personified by our forefathers
into deities, but the myths have been elaborated
to suit and correspond with the moral, intellectual
and emotional nature,—the inner life of man.
The deities have been conceived in a human form,
with human attributes and affections. The ancient
Norsemen have made their mythology reflect human
nature, and have clothed the gods with their own
faculties of mind and body in respect to good and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>evil, virtue and vice, right and wrong. As Rudolf
Keyser beautifully expresses himself:</p>

<p class='c010'>The gods are the ordaining powers of nature clothed in
personality. They direct the world, which they created; but
beside them stand the mighty goddesses of fate and time, the
great norns, who sustain the world-structure, the all-embraceing
tree of the world (Ygdrasil). The life of the world is a struggle
between the good and light gods on the one side, and the
offspring of chaotic matter, the giants, nature’s disturbing forces,
on the other. This struggle extends also into man’s being:
the spirit proceeds from the gods, the body belongs to the world of
the giants; they struggle with each other for the supremacy. If
the spirit conquers by virtue and bravery, man goes to heaven
after death, to fight in concert with the gods against the evil
powers; but if the body conquers and links the spirit to itself
by weakness and low desires, then man sinks after death to
the world of the giants in the lower regions, and joins himself
with the evil powers in the warfare against the gods.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nature is the mother at whose breast we all are
nourished. In ancient times she was the object of
childlike contemplation, nay, adoration. Nature and
men were in close communion with each other, much
closer than we are now. They had a more delicate
perception of, and more sympathy for, suffering nature;
and it were well if some of the purity of this thought
could be breathed down to us, their prosaic descendants,
who have abandoned the offerings to give place
to avarice (die Habsucht nahm zu, als die Opfer aufhörten.—Grimm).</p>

<p class='c004'>It was a beautiful custom, which is still preserved
in some parts of Norway, to fasten a bundle of grain
to a long pole, which on Christmas eve was erected
somewhere in the yard, or on the top of the house or
barn, for the wild birds to feed upon early on Christmas-day
morning,—(our heathen ancestors also had the
Christmas or Yule-tide festival). In our degenerate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>times we think of chickens and geese and turkeys,
but who thinks of the innocent and a suffering little
birds? Nay, our ancestors lay nearer to nature’s
breast. Have we had our hearts hardened by the iron
yoke of civilized government? We certainly need to
ask ourselves that question.</p>

<p class='c004'>The contemplation of the heavens produced the
myth about Odin, and the thunder-storm suggested
Thor, as in the Greek mythology Argos with his
hundred eyes represents the starry heavens, and the
wandering Io, whom Hera had set him to watch, is
the wandering moon. But stopping here would be
too prosaic; it would be leaving out the better half;
it would be giving the empty shell and throwing
away the kernel; it would be giving the skull
of the slain warrior without any ale in it; it would
be doing great injustice to our forefathers and robbing
ourselves of more than half of the intellectual
pleasure that a proper study of their myths afford.
The old Frisians contemplated the world as a huge
ship, by name Mannigfual (a counterpart of our ash-tree
Ygdrasil); the mountains were its masts; the
captain must go from one place to another of the
ship, giving his orders, on horseback; the sailors go
aloft as young men to make sail, and when they
come down again their hair and beard are white.
Ay, we are all sailors on board this great ship, and
we all have enough to do, each in his own way, to
climb its rope ladders and make and reef its sails, and
ere we are aware of it our hairs are gray; but take
the anthropomorphic element out of this myth, and
what is there left of it?</p>

<p class='c004'>Our ancestors were not prosaic. They were poetic
in the truest sense of that word. Our life is divided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>between the child, the vigorous man, and old age,—the
imaginative and prophetic child, the emotional and
active man, and the reflecting elder. So a nation,
which like the ancient Greek and Norse, for instance,
has had a natural growth and development, has first
its childhood of imagination and prophecy, producing
poetry (Homer and the Eddas); then its manhood
of emotion and activity, producing history (Herodotus
and the Sagas); and then its old age of mature reflection,
producing philosophy (Socrates). Dividing the
three periods in Greek history more definitely, we will
find that imagination and poetry predominated during
the whole time before Solon; emotion, activity and
history during the time between Solon and Alexander
the Great; and then reflection and philosophy, such as
they were, from Alexander to the collapse of the Greek
states.</p>

<p class='c004'>Even among the Romans, the most prosaic of all
peoples, that nation of subduers, enslavers and robbers,
traces of this growth from poetic childhood through
historic manhood to philosophic old age can be found,
which proves moreover that this is a law of human
development that cannot be eradicated, although it may
be perverted. That of the Romans is a most distorted
growth, showing that as the twig is bent the tree is
inclined. <i>Ut sementem feceris, ita metes</i>—as you sow,
so will you reap,—to quote the Romans’ own words
against them. The Romans had their poetic and prophetic
age during the reign of the seven kings; their
emotional and historical age during the most prosperous
and glorious epoch of the republic; and finally, their
age of reflection and philosophy began with the time
of the elder Cato. Rome took a distorted, misanthropic
course from the beginning, so that her profoundest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and most poetic myth is that of the <i>warlike</i>
Mars and the <i>rapacious wolf</i>, the father and nurse of
the <i>fratricide</i> Romulus. This myth is prophetic, and
in it the whole history of Rome is reflected as in
a mirror. The Romans themselves claim that their
Sibylline books (prophecy) belong to the time of their
kings. When, during the transition period from the
emotional to the philosophic age, Rome was to have
dramatic writers, she produced in comedy the clumsy
Plautus, whom the Romans employed in turning a
hand-mill; and in tragedy the flat Ennius, whose works
were lost; so that her only really poetical tragedy is
the fate of her dramatic poets. Her other poetical
works, of which the world has boasted so much, came
later, after the death of Cicero, their most famous orator,
during the life of the crowned Augustus; they came like
an Iliad after Homer, and the most of them was a poor
imitation of Greek literature, just as this book is a
poor imitation of Scandinavian literature. <i>Ex ipso
fonte dulcius bibuntur aquæ</i>—go to the fountain
itself if you want to drink the pure and sparkling
water. The Roman literature is eminently worthy of
the consideration of the historical philosopher, but it
ought not to be canonized and used to torture the life
out of students with.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Hebrews have their imaginative, poetic and
prophetic age from Genesis to Moses; their emotional
and historical age from Moses to Solomon, and then
begins their age of reflection and philosophy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Taking a grand, colossal, general view of the history
of the world, we would say that the ancients belong
chiefly to the poetic age, the middle ages to the emotional
and modern times to the reflecting age, of the
human race. Thus the life of the individual is, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>miniature, the life of a people or of the whole human
family.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was a digression, and we confess that it is not
the first one we have made; but in the world of thought,
as in the world of music, monotony is tedious; and
the reader having perhaps refreshed his mind by the
interlude, we will proceed to discuss further the union
of the ethical with the physical interpretation of
mythology. Physical interpretation alone is the shell
without the kernel. Nature gives us only the source
of the myth; but we want its value in the minds
and hearts of a people in their childhood. The touching
gracefulness of Nanna, and of Idun reclining on Brage’s
breast, was not suggested by nature alone, but the
pictures of these reflect corresponding natures in our
ancestors. To explain a myth simply by the phenomenon
in external nature (be it remembered, however,
that man also constitutes a part of nature) that
suggested it to the ancients, would be reducing mythology
to a natural science and it is sad to witness
how the beautiful and poetical Eddas, in the hands
of some, have dwindled down into the dry chemistry,
chronology, electro-magnetism, mathematics, astronomy,
or, if you please, the almanacs, of our forefathers,
instead of being presented as the grand, prophetic
drama which foreshadowed the heroic and enterprising
destiny of the Teutonic nations. The twelve dwellings
of the gods, they say, represent the twelve signs of
the zodiac; Balder they make the constellation of the
lion; Odin’s twelve names, they say, are the twelve
months of the year; his fifty-two names, which he
himself enumerates in Grimnismaal, are the fifty-two
weeks in the year; the thirteen valkyries are the thirteen
new moons in the year. How profound! How
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>perfectly everything adapts itself to the theory! This
invaluable discovery was made on the seventh of December,
1827. It ought to be a legal holiday! The
one ox, three measures of mead and eight salmon which
Thor, according to the Elder Edda, consumed, when
he had come to Jotunheim to fetch his hammer, they
claim also represent the year’s twelve months, for
1 + 3 + 8 = 12. Furthermore, the three gods, Haar, Jafnhaar,
and Thride, are the three fundamental elements,
sulphur, mercury, and salt; Odin, Vile, and Ve, are the
three laws of the universe, gravity, motion, and affinity.
Thor is electricity; his belt is an electric condenser,
his gloves an electric conductor. Hrungner, with whom
he contends, is petrifaction; the Mokkerkalfe, whom
Thjalfe slew, is the magnetic needle. Gunlad is oxygen,
Kvaser is sugar, etc. But this will do. Are not these
golden keys, with which to unlock the secret chambers
of the Eddas!</p>

<p class='c004'>All the deities do not represent phenomena and forces
of nature, and this fact gives if possible still more importance
to the anthropomorphic interpretation. Some
myths are mere creations of the imagination, to give
symmetry and poetical finish to the system, or we might
say to the drama—to complete the delineations of the
characters that appear on the stage of action. Hermod,
for instance, is no phenomenon in physical nature: he
is the servant of Odin in the character of the latter
as the god of war. Odin is the god of the heavens,
but it is not in this capacity he sends out the valkyries
to pick up the fallen heroes on the field of battle.</p>

<p class='c004'>In rejecting the <i>historical</i> interpretation, we do by
no means mean to deny the influence of the mythology
upon the social, religious, political and literary life of
the Norsemen. But this is not an explanation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>mythology itself, but of its influence upon the minds
of the people. If we mean it in a prophetic sense, the
Norse mythology has also an historical interpretation.
In it was mirrored the grand future of the Norse spirit;
by it the Norsemen were taught to make those daring
expeditions to every part of the civilized world, making
conquests and planting colonies; to cross the briny deep
and open the way to Iceland, Greenland and America;
to take possession of Normandy in France, subdue England
and make inroads into Spain and Italy; to pass
between the pillars of Hercules, devastate the classic
fields of Greece, and carve their mysterious runes on
the marble lion in Athens; to lay the foundations of
the Russian Empire, penetrate the walls of Constantinople
and swing their two-edged battle-axes in its streets;
to sail up the rivers Rhine, the Scheldt, the Seine, and
the Loire, conquering Cologne and Aachen and besieging
Paris; to lead the van of the chivalry of Europe in rescuing
the holy sepulchre and rule over Antioch and Tiberias
under Harald; to sever the fetters forged by the
Roman emperors, break the crosiers in the hands of the
Roman popes and infuse a nobler and freer spirit into
the nations of the earth; and by their mythology they
were taught to give to the world that germ of liberty
that struck root in the earliest literature of France, budded
in the Magna Charta of England, and developed its
full-blown flowers in the American Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The principal object of the second part of this volume
is to give a faithful, accurate and <i>complete</i> presentation
of the myths; but interpretations and reflections
will be freely indulged in. The basis of the interpretation
will be the physical and ethical combined, the
two taken as a unit. The reflections will consist in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>pointing out occasionally the fulfilment of the prophecies
historically, or rather the application of the myths
to historical philosophy. When only the physical source
of the myth is given, its anthropomorphic element must
be supplied in the mind of the reader. When Thor is
given as the impersonation of thunder, and Heimdal as
the rainbow, clothed with personality, then the reader
must consider what sensations would be awakened in his
own breast by these phenomena if he had been taught
to regard them as persons. And when he has given
them stature, gait, clothing, bearing, expression of the
eye and countenance, and personal character corresponding
with their lofty positions in the management of the
affairs of the world, then he can form some idea of these
deities as contemplated by the ancient Norsemen.</p>

  <h3 id='chap0-6' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='6'>VI</abbr>. <br /> THE NORSE MYTHOLOGY FURNISHES ABUNDANT AND EXCELLENT MATERIAL FOR THE USE OF POETS, SCULPTORS AND PAINTERS.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In a previous chapter it was claimed that the time
must come when Norse mythology will be copiously
reflected in our elegant literature and is our fine arts;
and we insist that we who are Goths, and branches of
the noble ash Ygdrasil, ought to develop some fibre,
leaves, buds and flowers with nourishment drawn from
the roots of our own tree of existence, and not be constantly
borrowing from our neighbors. If our poets
would but study Norse mythology, they would find in
it ample material for the most sublime poetry. The
Norse mythology is itself a finished poem, and has been
most beautifully presented in the Elder Edda, but it
furnishes at the same time a variety of themes that can
be combined and elaborated into new poems with all
the advantages of modern art, modern civilization and
enlightenment. With the spirit of Christianity, a touch
of beauty and grandeur can be unconsciously thrown
over the loftiness of stature, the growth of muscle, the
bold masses of intellectual masonry, the tempestuous
strength of passions, those gods and heroes of impetuous
natures and gigantic proportions, those overwhelming
tragedies of primitive vigor, which are to be found
in the Eddas. If our American poet would but pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>a visit to Urd’s fountain, to Time’s morning in our
Gothic history, and tarry there until the dawn tinges
the horizon with crimson and scarlet and the sun breaks
through the clouds and sends its inspiring rays into his
soul,—then his poetry and compositions would reflect
those auroral rays with intensified effulgence; it would
shine upon and enlighten and gladden a whole nation.
We need poets who can tell us, in words that burn,
about our Gothic ancestors, in order that we may be
better able to comprehend ourselves. It has heretofore
been explained how the history of nations divides itself
into three periods—the imaginative, the emotional, and
reflective; poetry, history, and philosophy; and how
these have their miniature counterparts in the life of
any single person—childhood, manhood, and old age;
and now we are prepared to present this claim, that the
poetic, imaginative and prophetic period of our race
should be compressed into the soul of the child. The
poetic period of <i>his own</i> race should be melted and
moulded into poetry, touched by a spark of Christian
refinement and love, and then poured, so to speak, into
the soul of the child. The child’s mind should feed
upon the mythological stories and the primitive folklore
of his race. It should be nourished with milk
from its own mother’s breast. Does any one doubt this?
Let him ask the Scandinavian poets: ask what kindled
the imaginative fancy of Welhaven; ask what inspired
the force and simplicity of phrase in Oelenschlæger’s
poetry; ask what produced the unadorned loveliness
with which Björnstjerne Björnson expresses himself, and
the mountain torrent that rushes onward with impetuous
speed in Wergeland; ask what produced the refinement
of phrase of Tegner, and the wild melodious
abandon of Ibsen;—and they will tell him that in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>deep defiles of that sea-girt and rock-bound land called
Norseland, where the snow-crowned mountains tower like
castle-walls, they found in a leafy summer bower a Saga-book
full of magic words and beautiful pictures, and,
like Alexander of old, they made this wonderful book
their pillow. They may tell you that the Scandinavian
schools, like the American, are pretty thoroughly Latinized,
but that they stole out of the school-room, studied
this Saga-book, and from it they drew their inspiration.</p>

<p class='c004'>The writer once asked the famous Norse violinist, Ole
Bull, what had inspired his musical talent and given his
music that weird, original, inexplicable expression and
style. He said, that from childhood he had taken a profound
delight in the picturesque and harmonious combination
of grandeur, majesty, and gracefulness of the
flower-clad valleys, the silver-crested mountains, the singing
brooks, babbling streams, thundering rivers, sylvan
shores and smiling lakes of his native land. He had
eagerly devoured all the folk-lore, all the stories about
trolls, elves and sprites that came within his reach; he
had especially reveled in all the mythological tales about
Odin, Thor, Balder, Ymer, the Midgard-serpent, Ragnarok,
etc.; and these things, he said, have made my music.
Truthfully has our own poet Longfellow, who has himself
taken more than one draft from Mimer’s fountain,
and communed more than once with Brage—said of
Ole Bull:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He lived in that ideal world</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose language is not speech, but song;</div>
      <div class='line'>Around him evermore the throng</div>
      <div class='line'>Of elves and sprites their dances whirled;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Strömkarl sang, the cataract hurled</div>
      <div class='line'>Its headlong waters from the height,</div>
      <div class='line'>And mingled in the wild delight</div>
      <div class='line'>The scream of sea-birds in their flight,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The rumor of the forest trees,</div>
      <div class='line'>The plunge of the implacable seas,</div>
      <div class='line'>The tumult of the wind at night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Voices of eld, like trumpets blowing</div>
      <div class='line'>Old ballads and wild melodies</div>
      <div class='line'>Through mist and darkness pouring forth</div>
      <div class='line'>Like Elivagar’s rivers flowing</div>
      <div class='line'>Out of the glaciers of the North.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>These are the things that make poets, and musicians
are poets. Then continues the same author:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And when he played, the atmosphere</div>
      <div class='line'>Was filled with music, and the ear</div>
      <div class='line'>Caught echo of that harp of gold</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose music had so weird a sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>The heeled stag forgot to bound,</div>
      <div class='line'>The leaping rivulet backward rolled,</div>
      <div class='line'>The bird came down from bush and tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>The dead came from beneath the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>The maiden to the harper’s knee.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Only these few lines make it clear that Longfellow has
not only communed with Brage, but has also refreshed
himself at the Castalian fountain; that he has not only
penetrated the mysteries of the Greek mythology, but has
also visited the deities of the North.</p>

<p class='c004'>If you do not believe that the Norse mythology furnishes
suitable themes for poetry, then do not echo the
voice of the multitude and cry the idea down because it
seems new. Men frequently act like ants. When a red ant
appears among the black ones, they all attack it, for they
have once for all made up their minds that all ants must
necessarily be black; they have themselves been black all
their lives, and all their ancestors were black, so far as
they know anything about them. Thus it has become a
fixed opinion with many, that mythology necessarily
means Greek or Roman. We said to one of our friends:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>We are writing a book on Norse mythology. Says our
learned friend: Are not those old stories about Jupiter
and Mars pretty well written up by this time? We
said we thought they were, too much so; but we are
writing about Odin and Thor. Then our learned friend
shook his head in surprise and said that he never heard
of those gentlemen before. If our reader’s case is the
same as that of our learned friend, then let him examine
the subject for himself. Let him read the Norse mythology
through carefully. Let him then tell us what themes
suggestive of sublime poetry he found in the upper, the
middle and the lower worlds of the Odinic mythology;
how he was impressed with the regions of the gods, of the
giants, and of the dwarfs; what he thought of the various
exploits of the gods; how he was impressed with the great
and wise Odin, the good and shining Balder, the mighty
Thor, the subtle and malicious Loke, the queenly Frigg,
the genial Frey, the lovely Idun reclining on the eloquent
Brage’s breast, and the gentle Nanna. Let him read and
see whether or not he will be delighted with all the magnificent
scenery of Gladsheim, Valhal, Midgard, Niflheim,
Muspelheim, and Ginungagap; with the norns Urd,
Verdande, and Skuld; with the glorious ash Ygdrasil;
with the fountain of Mimer (let him take a deep drink,
while he is there);, with the heavenly bridge Bifrost (the
rainbow), upon which the gods daily descend to the Urdar-fountain;
and with the wild tempest-traversed regions of
Ran (the goddess of the sea, wife of Æger). The celebrated
poet Oelenschlæger found in all these things inexhaustible
scope for poetic embellishments, and he availed
himself of it in his work, entitled <i>Gods of the North</i>, with
the zeal and power of a genuine poet. He revived the
memories of the past. He bade the gods come forward
out of the mists of the centuries, and he accomplished in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>less than fifty years what <i>Latin</i> versions of the Eddas had
not been able to accomplish in three centuries. Two of
Oelenschlæger’s poems are given translated in <i>Poets and
Poetry of Europe</i>, and Mr. Longfellow has given us permission
to present them here. We will now avail ourselves
of his kindness and not discuss this portion of the
subject of this chapter any further, knowing that the
reader will find the poems <i>Thor’s Fishing</i> and <i>The
Dwarfs</i> far more pleasing and convincing than any
additional arguments we might be able to produce.
Here they are:</p>

<p class='c009'>There remains now to discuss briefly whether the
Norse mythology furnishes subjects for painting and
sculpturing. If the reader has become convinced that
there is material in it worthy of the greatest poet,
then it is not necessary to say much about painting
and sculpturing; for we know that most things that
can be said in verse can be made visible on the canvas,
or be chiseled in marble. We shall therefore be
brief on this particular point, but after the presentation
of a few subjects for the painter or sculptor,
we shall have something to say about nude art.</p>

<p class='c004'>Can the brush or the chisel ask for more suggestive
subjects than Odin, Balder, Thor, Frey, Idun, Nanna,
Loke, etc.? or groups like the norns at the Urdar-fountain?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>or Urd (the past) and Verdande (the present),
who stretch from east to west a web, which is torn
to pieces by Skuld (the future); the valkyries in the
heat of the battle picking up the slain; or when they
carry the fallen Hakon Adelsten to Valhal? Cannot
a beautiful picture be made of Æger and Ran and their
daughters, the waves? of the gods holding their feast
with Æger and sending out Thor to fetch a caldron
for them from Jotunheim? or of Thor clapping the
pot on his head like a huge hat and walking off with
it? What more touching scene can be perceived
than the death of Balder? Only in that short poem
Hamarsheimt (fetching the hammer) there are no less
than three beautiful subjects: (1) Thor wakes up and
misses his hammer; he feels around him for it; he
is surprised and hesitates; he wrinkles his brows and
his head trembles. Loke looks down upon him from
above; the rogue is in his eye; he would like to break
out in a roar of laughter, but dare not. (2) All the
gods are engaged in dressing Thor in Freyja’s clothes;
he is a tall straight youth with golden hair and a
fine brown beard; lightning flashes from his eyes;
while Fulla puts on him Freyja’s jewels there is a terrible
conflict going on in his breast with this humiliation
of his dignity, which he cannot overcome. Loke
stands half-ready near by as maid-servant; he dresses
Thor’s hair and is himself half-covered by the bridal-veil
which Thor is to wear. All take an intense
interest in the work, for they are so anxious to have
the stratagem succeed. (3) The giants have laid the
hammer in the lap of the bride; Thor seizes it, and
as he pushes aside the veil he literally grows into his
majestic divinity, for whenever he wields his mighty
Mjolner his strength is redoubled. The disappointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>desire of Thrym, the astounded giants, the amused
Loke; all furnish an endless variety of excellent material
for the brush of the painter. The plastic art can
find no more exquisite group than Loke bound upon
three stones, and his loving wife, Sigyn, leaning over
him with a dish, wherein she catches the drops of
venom that would otherwise fall into his face and intensify
his agonies. A volume of themes might be presented,
but it is not necessary. Suffice it then to say
that for poetry, painting and the plastic arts, there is
in the Norse mythology a fountain of delight whose
waters but few have tasted, but which no man can
drain dry.</p>

<p class='c004'>We promised to say something about nude art. It
is this: We Goths are, and have forever been, a <i>chaste</i>
race. We abhor the loathsome nudity of Greek art.
We do not want nude figures, at least not unless they
embody some very sublime thought. The people of
southern Europe differ widely from us Northerners in
this respect; and this difference reaches far back into our
respective mythologies, adding additional proof to the
fact that the myths foreshadow the social life of a nation
or race of people. The Greek gods were generally conceived
as nude, and hence Greek art would naturally be
nude also. Whether the licentiousness and lasciviousness
of the Greek communities were the primary causes
of the unæsthetical features of their mythology or their
Bacchanalian revels sprang from the mythology, it is
difficult to determine. We undoubtedly come nearest
the truth when we say that the same primeval causes
produced both the social life and mythology of the
Greeks; that there thenceforward was an active reciprocating
influence between the religion on the one side
and the popular life on the other, an influence that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>we may liken unto that which operates between the
soul and the body; and thus it may be said that the mythology
and the popular life combined produced their
nude art. To say that the popular character of the
Greeks, taken individually or collectively, was stimulated
into life by their mythology; that the virtues
and the vices of the people originated in it <i>alone</i>;
would certainly be an incorrect and one-sided view of
the subject. The Greeks brought with them, from their
original home into Greece, the germs of that faith which
afterwards became developed in a certain direction under
the influence of the popular life and the action of
external circumstances upon that life, but which in turn
reacted upon the popular life with a power which
increased in proportion as the system of mythology
acquired by development a more decided character.
The same is true of the Norsemen and of the Goths
in general. When it is found, for instance, that the
mythological representation of Odin as father of the
slain (Val-father), and that Valhal (the hall of the slain),
the valkyries and einherjes, contain a strong incentive
to warlike deeds, then it must not be imagined that this
martial spirit, that displayed itself so powerfully among
the Goths generally, and among the Norsemen particularly,
was the offspring of the mythology of our ancestors;
but we may rather conceive that the Norsemen
were from the beginning a race of remarkable physical
power, that accidental external causes, such as severe
climate, mountainous country, conflicts with neighboring
peoples, etc., brought this inherent physical force
into activity and thus awakened the warlike spirit; and
then it may be said that this martial spirit stamped
itself upon their religious ideas, upon their mythology,
and finally that the mythology, when it had received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>this characteristic impress from the people, again reacted
to preserve and even further inflame that martial spirit.
And there is no inconsistency between this view of the
subject and that which was presented in the third
chapter.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was said at the outset that we Goths are a chaste
race, and abhor the loathsome nudity of Greek art.
We were a chaste people before our fathers came under
the influence of Christianity. The Elder Edda, which
is the grand depository of the Norse mythology, may
be searched through and through, and there will not
be found a single nude myth, not an impersonation of
any kind that can be considered an outrage upon virtue
or a violation of the laws of propriety; and this feature
of the Odinic religion deserves to be urged as an
important reason why our painters and sculptors should
look at home for something wherewith to employ their
talent, before they go abroad; look in our own ancient
Gothic history, before going to ancient Greece.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the artist who is going to chisel out an Odin,
a Thor, a Balder, a Nanna, or a Loke, must not be a
mere imitator. He must possess a creative mind. He
must not go to work at a piece of Norse art with his
imagination full of Greek myths, much less must he
attempt to apply Greek principles to a piece of Gothic
art. He will find the Norse chisel a somewhat more
ponderous weapon to swing; and you cannot turn as
rapidly with a railroad car as you can with a French
<i>fiacre</i> or American gig. To try to chisel out the gods
of <i>our</i> forefathers after South European patterns would
be like attempting to write English with the mind full
of Latin syntax. Hence we repeat, that we do not
want an imitator, but an original genius. Greek mythology
has been presented so many times, and so well,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>that the imitation, the repetition, is comparatively easy.
He who would bring out Gothic art (and but little of
it has hitherto been brought out) must himself be a
poet, and what a mine of wealth there is open to him!
Would that genuine art fever would attack our artists
and that some of the treasures that lie hid in the
granite quarries of the Norse mythology might speedily
be exhumed!</p>

<p class='c004'>In his work, entitled <i>Science of Beauty</i>, Dr. John
Bascom has taken decided grounds against nude figures
in art. We would recommend the eighth chapter of
that work to the careful consideration of the reader.
We are not able for want of space to give his opinion
in full, but make the following brief extract:</p>

<p class='c010'>There is one direction in which art has indulged itself in a
most marked violation of propriety, and that too on the side of
vice. I refer to the frequent nudity of its figures. This is a
point upon which artists have been pretty unanimous, and disposed
to treat the opinions of others with <i>hauteur</i> and disdain,
as arising at best from a virtue more itching and sensitive than
wise, from instincts more physical than æsthetical. This practice
has been more abused in painting than in sculpture, both as less
needed, and hence less justifiable, and as ever tending to become
more loose and lustful in the double symbols of color and form,
than when confined to the pure, stern use of the latter in stone
or metal. Despite alleged necessities,—despite the high-toned
claims and undisguised contempt of artists,—our convictions are
strongly against the practice, as alike injurious to taste and
morals. Indeed, if injurious to morals, it cannot be otherwise
than injurious to taste, since art has no more dangerous enemy
than a lascivious perverted fancy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nay, in the radiant dawn of our Gothic history
our poets and artists may, if they would but look for
them, find chaste themes to which they may consecrate
the whole ardor of their souls for the æsthetical elevation
and ennoblement of our race. As a people we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>growing too prosaic and, therefore, too ungodly; we
nourish the tender minds of our children too early and
too extensively on dry reasoning, mathematics and philosophy,
instead of strengthening, stimulating and beautifying
their souls with some of the poetic thoughts, some
of the mythology and folk-lore of our forefathers. These
mythological stories, these fairy tales and all this folk-lore,
illuminated by the genial rays of the Christian
religion shining upon them, should be made available
in our families and schools, by our poets, painters and
sculptors, and then our children would in turn get their
æsthetical natures developed so as to be able to beautify
their own life and that of their posterity with still
finer productions in poetry, painting, and sculpture.</p>

  <h3 id='chap0-7' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='7'>VII</abbr>. <br /> THE SOURCES OF NORSE MYTHOLOGY AND INFLUENCE OF THE ASA-FAITH.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In order to thoroughly comprehend the Odinic mythology
it is necessary to make a careful study of the
history, literature, languages and dialects of the Teutonic
races and of their popular life in all its various
manifestations.</p>

<p class='c004'>The chief depositories of the Norse mythology are
the Elder or Sæmund’s Edda (poetry) and the Younger
or Snorre’s Edda (prose). In Icelandic <i>Edda</i> means
<i>great-grandmother</i>, and some think this appellation refers
to the ancient origin of the myths it contains.
Others connect it with the Indian <i>Veda</i> and the Norse
<i>vide</i> (Swedish <i>veta</i>, to know).</p>
<h4 class='c015'><abbr title='1'>I</abbr>. The Elder Edda.</h4>
<p class='c006'>This work was evidently collected from the mouths
of the people in the same manner as Homer’s <i>Iliad</i>,
and there is a similar uncertainty in regard to who put it
in writing. It has generally been supposed that the songs
of the Elder Edda were collected by Sæmund the Wise
(born 1056, died 1133), but Sophus Bugge and <abbr class='spell'>N. M.</abbr>
Petersen, both eminent Icelandic scholars, have made
it seem quite probable that it was not put in writing
before the year 1240. This is not the place for a discussion
of this difficult question, and the reader is referred
to Sophus Bugge’s Introduction to <i>Sæmundar Edda</i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>to Petersen’s <i>History of Northern Literature</i>, if he wishes
to investigate this subject. There are thirty-nine poems
in the Elder Edda, and we have here to look at their
contents. Like the most of the Icelandic poetry, these
poems do not distinguish themselves, as does the poetry of
Greece and Rome, by a metrical system based on quantity,
but have an arrangement of their own in common
with the poetry of the other old Gothic nations, the Anglo-Saxons,
etc. This system consists chiefly in the number
of <i>long syllables</i> and in <i>alliteration</i>. The songs are
divided into strophes commonly containing eight verses
or lines. These strophes are usually divided into two
halves, and each of these halves again into two parts,
which form a fourth part of the whole strophe, and
contain two verses belonging together and united by
alliteration.</p>

<p class='c004'>The alliteration (letter rhyme) is the most essential
element in Icelandic versification. It is found in all
kinds of verse and in every age, the Icelanders still
using it; and its nature is this, that in the two lines
belonging together, three words occur beginning with
the same letter, two of which must be in the first
line and the third in the beginning of the second.
The third and last of these is called the chief letter
(<i>höfuðstafr</i>, head-stave), because it is regarded as ruling
over the two others which depend on it and have the
name sub-letters (<i>studlar</i>, supporters). All rhyme-letters
must be found in accented syllables, and no more
words in the two lines should begin with the same
letter—at least no chief word, which takes the accent
on the first syllable. This principle is illustrated by
the following first half of the seventh strophe of Völuspá,
the oldest song in the Elder Edda:</p>

<p class='c004'>The poems of the Elder Edda are in no special
connection one with the other, and they may be divided
into three classes: purely mythological, mythological-didactic,
and mythological-historical poems.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Elder Edda presents the Norse cosmogony,
the doctrines of the Odinic mythology, and the lives
and doings of the gods. It contains also a cycle
of poems on the demi-gods and mythic heroes and
heroines of the same period. It gives us as complete
a view of the mythological world of the North as
Homer and Hesiod do of that of Greece. But (to use
in part the language of the Howitts) it presents this
to us not as Homer does, worked up into one great
poem, but as the rhapsodists of Greece presented to
Homer’s hands the materials for that great poem in
the various hymns and ballads of the fall of Troy,
which they sung all over Greece. No Homer ever
arose in Norseland to mould all these sublime lyrics
of the Elder Edda into one lordly epic. The story of
Siegfried and Brynhild, which occupies the latter portion
of the Elder Edda, was, in later times in Germany
moulded into the great and beautiful <i>Niebelungen-Lied</i>;
although it was much altered by the German poet or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>by German tradition. The poems of the Elder Edda
show us what the myths of Greece would have been
without a Homer. They remain huge, wild and fragmentary;
full of strange gaps rent into their very vitals
by the strokes of rude centuries; yet like the ruin of
the Colosseum or the temples of Pæstum, standing aloft
amid the daylight of the present time, magnificent testimonials
of the stupendous genius of the race which
reared them. There is nothing besides the Bible,
which sits in a divine tranquillity of unapproachable
nobility like a king of kings amongst all other books,
and the poem of Homer itself, which can compare
in all the elements of greatness with the Edda. There
is a loftiness of stature, and a firmness of muscle
about it which no poets of the same race have ever
since reached. The only production since, that can
be compared with the Elder Edda in profoundness of
thought, is that of Shakespeare, the Hercules or Thor
in English literature, that heroic mind of divine lineage
which passed through the hell-gates of the Roman
school-system unscathed. The obscurity which still
hangs over some parts of the Elder Edda, like the deep
shadows crouching amid the ruins of the past, is the
result of neglect, and will in due time be removed;
but amid this stand forth the boldest masses of intellectual
masonry. We are astonished at the wisdom
which is shaped into maxims, and at the tempestuous
strength of passions to which all modern emotions seem
puny and constrained. Amid the bright sun-light of
a far-off time, surrounded by the densest shadows of
forgotten ages, we come at once into the midst of gods
and heroes, goddesses and fair women, giants and dwarfs,
moving about in a world of wonderful construction,
unlike any other world or creation which God has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>founded or man has imagined, but still beautiful beyond
conception.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Elder Edda opens with Völuspá (the vala’s
prophecy), and this song may be regarded as one of
the oldest, if not the oldest, poetic monument of the
North. In it the mysterious vala, or prophetess, seated
somewhere unseen in the marvelous heaven, sings an
awful song of the birth of gods and men; of the great
Ygdrasil, or Tree of Existence, whose roots and branches
extend through all regions of space, and concludes her
thrilling hymn with the terrible Ragnarok, or Twilight
of the gods, when Odin and the other gods perish in
the flames that devour all creation, and the new heavens
and new earth rise beautifully green to receive the reign
of Balder and of milder natures.</p>

<p class='c004'>The second song in the Elder Edda is Hávamál (the
high-song of Odin). Odin himself is represented as its
author. It contains a pretty complete code of Odinic
morality and precepts of wisdom. The moral and social
axioms that are brought together in Hávamál will surprise
the reader, who has been accustomed to regard the
Norsemen as a rude and half wild race, hunting in the
savage forests of the North, or scouring the coasts of
Europe in quest of plunder. They contain a profound
knowledge, not merely of human nature, but of human
nature in its various social and domestic relations. They
are more like the proverbs of Solomon than anything in
human literature.</p>

<p class='c004'>The third poem in the Elder Edda is Vafthrudnismál
(that is, Vafthrudner’s speech or song). Vafthrudner is
derived from <i>vaf</i>, a web or weaving, and <i>thrúð</i>, strong;
hence Vafthrudner is the <i>powerful weaver</i>, the one powerful
in riddles, and it is the name of a giant, who in the
first part of the poem propounds a series of intricate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>questions or riddles. Odin tells his wife Frigg that he
desires to visit the all-wise giant Vafthrudner, to find
out from him the secrets of the past and measure strength
with him. Frigg advises him not to undertake this
journey, saying that she considers Vafthrudner the
strongest of all giants. Odin reminds her of his many
perilous adventures and experiences, arguing that these
are sufficient to secure him in his curiosity to see Vafthrudner’s
halls. Frigg wishes him a prosperous journey
and safe return, and also the necessary presence of
mind at his meeting with the giant. Odin then proceeds
on his journey and enters the halls of Vafthrudner
in the guise of a mortal wayfarer, by name Gangraad.
He greets the lord of the house, and says he is come to
learn whether he was a wise or omniscient giant. Such
an address vexes Vafthrudner, coming as it did from a
stranger, and he soon informs Gangraad that if he is
not wiser than himself he shall not leave the hall alive.
But the giant, finding, after he had asked the stranger
a few questions, that he really had a worthy antagonist
in his presence, invites him to take a seat, and challenges
him to enter into a disputation, that they might measure
their intellectual strength, on the condition that the vanquished
party—the one unable to answer a question put
to him by the other—should forfeit his head. Odin
accepts this dangerous challenge. They accordingly discuss,
by question and answer, the principal topics of
Norse mythology. The pretended Gangraad asks the
giant many questions, which the latter answers correctly;
but when the former at length asks his adversary what
Odin whispered in the ear of his son Balder before he
had been placed on the funeral pile—a question by
which the astonished giant becomes aware that his antagonist
is Odin himself, who was alone capable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>answering it,—the giant acknowledges himself vanquished,
and sees with terror that he cannot avoid the
death which he in his cruel pride had intended to inflict
upon an innocent wanderer.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fourth song is Grimnismál (the song of Grimner).
It begins with a preface in prose, in which it is
related that Odin, under the name of Grimner, visited
his foster-son Geirrod, and the latter, deceived by a false
representation by Frigg, takes him for a sorcerer, makes
him sit between two fires and pine there without nourishment
for eight days, until Agnar, the king’s son,
reaches him a drinking-horn. Hereupon Grimner sings
the song which bears his name. Lamenting his confinement
and blessing Agnar, he goes on to picture the
twelve abodes of the gods and the splendors of Valhal,
which he describes at length, and then speaks of the
mythological world-tree Ygdrasil, of the valkyries, of
the giant Ymer, of the ship Skidbladner, and adds
various other cosmological explanations.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fifth song is Skirnismál, or För Skirnis (the
journey of Skirner). This gives in the form of a dialogue
the story of Frey and Gerd, of his love to her,
and his wooing her through the agency of his faithful
servant Skirner, after whom the song is named.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sixth is the Lay of Harbard. It is a dialogue
between Thor and the ferryman Harbard, who refuses
to carry him over the stream. This furnishes an occasion
for each of them to recount his exploits. They
contrast their deeds and exploits. The contest is continued
without interruption until near the end of the
poem, where Thor finally offers a compromise, again requesting
to be taken over the river. Harbard, who is
in fact Odin, again refuses in decided terms. Then
Thor asks him to show him another way. This request
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Harbard seems in a manner to comply with, but refers
Thor to Fjorgyn, his mother. Thor asks how far it
is, but Harbard makes enigmatical answers. Thor
ends the conversation with threats and Harbard with
evil wishes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The seventh poem is the Song of Hymer. The gods
of Asgard are invited to a banquet with the sea-god
Æger. Thor goes to the giant Hymer for a large kettle,
in which to brew ale for the occasion. When Thor
has arrived at the home of Hymer he persuades the
giant to take him along on a fishing expedition, in
which Thor fishes up the Midgard-serpent, which he
would have killed had it not been for Hymer, who cut
off the fish-line. Thor succeeds in carrying off the
kettle, but has to slay Hymer and other giants who
pursue him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The eighth is Lokasenna (or Loke’s quarrel.) This
poem has a preface in prose. This is also a banquet at
Æger’s. It takes place immediately after Balder’s death.
Loke was present. He slew one of Æger’s servants and
had to flee to the woods, but soon returns, enters Æger’s
hall, and immediately begins to abuse the gods in the
most shameful manner: first Brage, then Idun, Gefjun,
Odin, Frigg, Freyja, Njord, and the others, until Thor
finally appears and drives him away. There is a prose
conclusion to this poem, describing Loke’s punishment
A profound tragedy characterizes this poem. Although
Loke is abusive, he still speaks the truth, and he exposes
all the faults of the gods, which foreshadow their
final fall. Peace disappeared with the death of Balder,
and the gods, conscious that Ragnarok is inevitable,
are overpowered by distraction and sorrow.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ninth poem is the Song of Thrym. This gives
an account of the loss of Thor’s hammer, and tells how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Loke helped him to get it back from the giant Thrym.</p>

<p class='c004'>The tenth is the Song of Alvis (the all-wise). Alvis
comes for Thor’s daughter as his bride. Thor cunningly
detains him all night by asking him questions concerning
the various worlds he has visited. Alvis answers
and teaches him the names by which the most important
things in nature are called in the respective languages
of different worlds: of men, of the gods, of the
vans, of the giants, of the elves, of the dwarfs, and
finally of the realms of the dead and of the supreme
god. The dwarf, being one of those mythical objects
which cannot endure the light of day, was detained till
dawn without accomplishing his object.</p>

<p class='c004'>The eleventh poem is Vegtam’s Lay. Odin assumes
the name Vegtam. In order to arrive at certainty concerning
the portentous future of the gods, he descends
to Niflheim, goes into the abodes of Hel, and calls the
vala up from her grave-mound, asking her about the
fate of Balder. She listens to him indignantly, answers
his questions unwillingly, but at last discovers that Vegtam
is the king of the gods, and angrily tells him to
ride home.</p>

<p class='c004'>We will omit a synopsis of the remainder, and
merely give their titles, as they do not enter so completely
into the system of mythology as the first eleven:
(12) Rigsmaal (Song of Rig), (13) The Lay of Hyndla,
(14) The Song of Volund, (15) The Song of Helge Hjorvardson,
(16) Song of Helge Hundingsbane I, (17) Song
of Helge Hundingsbane II, (18) Song of Sigurd Fafnisbane
I, (19) Song of Sigurd Fafnisbane II, (20) Song
of Fafner, (21) Song of Sigdrifa, (22) Song of Sigurd,
(23) Song of Gudrun I, (24) Song of Gudrun III, (25)
Brynhild’s Ride to Hel, (26) Song of Gudrun II, (27)
Song of Gudrun III, (28) The Weeping of Odrun, (29)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>The Song of Atle, (30) The Speech of Atle, (31) The
Challenge of Gudrun, (32) The Song of Hamder, (33)
The Song of Grotte, (34) Extracts from the Younger
Edda, (35) Extracts from the Volsunga Saga, (36) Song
of Svipdag I, (37) Song of Svipdag II, (38) The Lay
of the Sun, (39) Odin’s Raven-Cry.</p>

<p class='c004'>The antiquity of these poems cannot be fixed, but
they certainly carry us back to the remotest period of
the settlement of Norway by the Goths.</p>

<p class='c004'>It may be added here that many of the poems of the
Elder Edda, as well as much of the Old Norse poetry
generally, are very difficult to understand, on account
of the bold metaphorical language in which they are
written. The poet did not call an object by its usual
name, but borrowed a figure by which to present it,
either from the mythology or from some other source.
Thus he would call the sky <i>the skull of the giant Ymer</i>;
the rainbow he called <i>the bridge of the gods</i>; gold was
<i>the tears of Freyja</i>; poetry, <i>the present</i> or <i>drink of Odin</i>.
The earth was called indifferently <i>the wife of Odin</i>, <i>the
flesh of Ymer</i>, <i>the daughter of night</i>, <i>the vessel that
floats on the ages</i>, or <i>the foundation of the air</i>; herbs
and plants were called <i>the hair</i> or <i>the fleece of the
earth</i>. A battle was called <i>a bath of blood</i>, <i>the hail of
Odin</i>, <i>the shock of bucklers</i>; the sea was termed <i>the
field of pirates</i>, <i>the girdle of the earth</i>; ice, <i>the greatest
of all bridges</i>; a ship, <i>the horse of the waves</i>; the
tongue, <i>the sword of words</i>, etc.</p>
<h4 class='c015'><abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. The Younger Edda,</h4>
<p class='c006'>written by Snorre Sturleson, the author of the famous
<i>Heimskringla</i> (born 1178, died 1241) is mostly prose, and
may be regarded as a sort of commentary upon the
Elder Edda. The prose Edda consists of two parts:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Gylfaginning (the deluding of Gylfe), and the Bragaræður
or Skáldskaparmál (the conversations of Brage, the
god of poetry, or the treatise on poetry). Gylfaginning
tells how the Swedish king Gylfe makes a journey to
Asgard, the abode of the gods, where Odin instructs
him in the old faith, and gradually relates to him
the myths of the Norsemen. The manner in which
the whole is told reminds us of <i>A Thousand and One
Nights</i>, or of poems from a later time, as for instance
Boccaccio’s <i>Decameron</i>. It is a prose synopsis of the
whole Asa faith, with here and there a quotation
from the Elder Edda by way of elucidation. It shows
a great deal of ingenuity and talent on the part of
its author, and is the most perspicuous and clear
presentation of the mythology that we possess.</p>

<p class='c004'>But all the material for the correct presentation
of the Norse mythology is not found in the Eddas;
or rather we do not perfectly understand the Eddas,
if we confine our studies to them alone. For a full
comprehension of the myths, it is necessary to study
carefully all the semi-mythological Icelandic Sagas,
which constitute a respectable library by themselves;
and in connection with these we must read the Anglo-Saxon
<i>Beowulf’s Drapa</i>, and the German <i>Niebelungen-Lied</i>.
In the next place, we must examine carefully
all the folk-lore of the Gothic race, and we must, in
short, study the manifestations of the Gothic mind
and spirit everywhere: in the development of the
State and of the Church, in their poetry and history,
in their various languages and numerous dialects, in
their literature, in their customs and manners, and
in their popular belief. If we neglect all these we
shall never understand the Eddas; if we neglect the
Eddas we shall never understand the other sources of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>mythology. They mutually explain each other, and
the Gothic race must sooner or later begin to study
its own history.</p>

<p class='c004'>That the Odinic mythology exercised a mighty influence
in forming the national character of the Norsemen,
becomes evident when we compare the doctrines
of their faith with the popular life as portrayed in the
Sagas. Still we must bear in mind that this national
spirit was not created by this faith. The harsh climate
of the North modified not only the Norse mythology,
but also moulded indefinitely the national
character, and then the two, the mythology and the
national character, acted and reacted upon each other.
Thus bred up to fight with nature in a constant
battle for existence, and witnessing the same struggle
in the life of his gods, the Norseman became fearless,
honest and truthful, ready to smite and ready to forgive,
shrinking not from pain himself and careless
about inflicting it on others. Beholding in external
nature and in his mythology the struggle of conflicting
forces, he naturally looked on life as a field for
warfare. The ice-bound fjords and desolate fells, the
mournful wail of the waving pine-branches, the stern
strife of frost and fire, the annual death of the short-lived
summer, made the Norseman sombre, if not
gloomy, in his thoughts, and inured him to the rugged
independence of the country. The sternness of the land
in which he lived was reflected in his character; the
latter was in turn reflected in the tales which he
told of his gods and heroes, and thus the Norseman
and his mythology mutually influenced each other.</p>

<p class='c004'>The influence of the Asa faith, says Prof. Keyser,
upon the popular spirit of the Norsemen, must be regarded
from quite another point of view than that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of Christianity at a later period. The Asa faith was,
so to speak, inborn with the Norsemen, as it had developed
itself from certain germs and assumed form
with the popular life almost unconsciously to the latter.
Christianity, on the other hand, was given to the people
as a religious system complete in itself, intended for
all the nations of the earth; one which by its own
divine power opened for itself a way to conviction, and
through that conviction operated on the popular spirit
in a direction previously pointed out by the fundamental
principles of the religion itself. As the system
of the Asa faith arose without any conscious object of
affecting the morals, therefore it did not embrace any
actual code of morals in the higher sense of this term.
The Asa doctrine does not pronounce by positive expression
what is virtue and what is vice; it presupposes
a consciousness thereof in its votaries. It only represents
virtue as reaping its own rewards and vice its
own punishment, if not here upon the earth, then
with certainty beyond the grave. Thus Keyser.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Norse system of mythology embodied the doctrine
of an imperishable soul in man; it had Valhal
and Gimle set apart for and awaiting the brave and
virtuous, and Helheim and Naastrand for the wicked.</p>

<p class='c004'>The moral and social maxims of the Norsemen are
represented as being uttered by Odin himself in the
Hávamál (high song of Odin), the second song of the
Elder Edda, and by the valkyrie Sigdrifa in the Sigrdrífumál
(the lay of Sigdrifa), the twenty-first poem of
the same work. Read these poems and maxims, and
judge whether they will warrant the position repeatedly
taken in this work, that the electric spark that has
made England and America great and free came not
from the aboriginal Britons, not from the Roman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>enslavers, but must be sought in the prophetic, imaginative
and poetic childhood of the Gothic race. Read
these poems and judge whether the eminent English
writer, Samuel Laing, is right when he says:</p>

<p class='c010'>All that men hope for of good government and future improvement
in their physical and moral condition,—all that
civilized men enjoy at this day of civil, religious and political
liberty,—the British constitution, representative legislation, the
trial by jury, security of property, freedom of mind and person,
the influence of public opinion over the conduct of public affairs,
the Reformation, the liberty of the press, the spirit of the age,—all
that is or has been of value to man in modern times as a
member of society, either in Europe or in the New World, may
be traced to the spark left burning upon our shores by these
northern barbarians.</p>

<p class='c009'>Read these poems and find truth in the words of
Baron Montesquieu, the admirable author of <i>The Spirit
of Laws</i> (L’Esprit des Lois), when he says: The great
prerogative of Scandinavia, and what ought to recommend
its inhabitants beyond every people upon earth,
is, that they afforded the great resource to the liberty
of Europe, that is, to almost all the liberty that is
among men; and when he calls the North the forge
of those instruments which broke the fetters manufactured
in the South.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the old Gothic religion were embodied principles
and elements which had a tendency to make its votaries
brave, independent, honest, earnest, just, charitable, prudent,
temperate, liberty-loving, etc.; principles and morals
that in due course of time and under favorable circumstances
evolved the Republic of Iceland, the Magna
Charta of England, and the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rules of life as indicated by the High Song of
Odin and in Sigrdrífumál, in which the valkyrie gives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>counsel to Sigurd Fafnisbane, are briefly summed up
by Professor Keyser as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>1. The recognition of the depravity of human nature, which
calls for a struggle against our natural desires and forbearance
toward the weakness of others.</p>

<p class='c011'>2. Courage and faith both to bear the hard decrees of the
norns and to fight against enemies.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. The struggle for independence in life with regard to
knowledge as well as to fortune; an independence which should,
therefore, be earned by a love of learning and industry.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. A strict adherence to oaths and promises.</p>

<p class='c011'>5. Candor and fidelity as well as foresight in love, devotion
to the tried friend, but dissimulation toward the false and war
to the death against the implacable enemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>6. Respect for old age.</p>

<p class='c011'>7. Hospitality, liberality, and charity to the poor.</p>

<p class='c011'>8. A prudent foresight in word and deed.</p>

<p class='c011'>9. Temperance, not only in the gratification of the senses, but
also in the exercise of power.</p>

<p class='c011'>10. Contentment and cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='c011'>11. Modesty and politeness in intercourse.</p>

<p class='c011'>12. A desire to win the good will of our fellow men, especially
to surround ourselves with a steadfast circle of devoted
kinsmen and faithful friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>13. A careful treatment of the bodies of the dead.</p>

wisdom to mankind in</p>

<p class='c006'>Sigurd rode up the Hindarfiall, and directed his
course southward toward Frankland. In the fell he
saw a great light, as if a fire were burning, which
blazed up to the sky. On approaching it, there stood a
<i>skialdborg</i>, and over it a banner. Sigurd went into the
skialdborg, and saw a warrior lying within it asleep,
completely armed. He first took the helmet off the
warrior’s head, and saw that it was a woman. Her
corselet was as fast as if it had grown to her body.
With his sword, Gram, he ripped the corselet from the
upper opening downwards, and then through both
sleeves. He then took the corselet off from her, when
she awoke, sat up, and, on seeing Sigurd, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>She was named Sigdrifa, and was a valkyrie. She
said that two kings had made war on each other, one
of whom was named Hialmgunnar; he was old and a
great warrior, and Odin had promised him victory. The
other was Agnar, a brother of Aud, whom no divinity
would patronize. Sigdrifa overcame Hialmgunnar in
battle; in revenge for which Odin pricked her with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>sleep-thorn, and declared that thenceforth she should
never have victory in battle, and should be given in
marriage. But, said she, I said to him that I had
bound myself by a vow not to espouse any man who
could be made to fear. Sigurd answers, and implores

<p class='c009'>Sigurd said: A wiser mortal exists not, and I swear
that I will possess thee, for thou art after my heart.
She answered: Thee I will have before all others,
though I have to choose among all men. And this
they confirmed with oaths to each other.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here ends the lay of Sigdrifa.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reader may find some of these rules of <i>Hávamál</i>
and <i>Sigrdrífumál</i> somewhat inconsistent with our ideas
of a supreme deity; but are not many of these principles
laid down in the Odinic morality worthy of a
Christian age and of a Christian people, and do they
not all reveal a profound knowledge of human nature
in all its various phases?</p>

<p class='c004'>These rules of life, says Professor Keyser, were variously
understood, and as variously carried out into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>practice. But on the whole we find them reflected in
the popular character of the Norsemen, such as history
teaches it to us during heathendom. Bravery, prudence,
and a love of independence are its brightest features,
although bravery often degenerated into warrior fierceness,
prudence into dissimulation, and the love of independence
into self-will. If on the one hand we find a
noble self-command, devoted faithfulness in friendship
and love, noble-hearted hospitality and generosity, a love
of right and of legal order, we also see on the other
hand, unyielding stubbornness, a fierce spirit of revenge,
a repulsive arrogance, a far-reaching self-interest, and an
excessive dependence upon the formalities of the law.
A cold and unmoved exterior often concealed a soul
torn by the bitterest grief, or stirred up by the wildest
passions. A passionate outburst of joy or of grief was
considered undignified. Few words, but energetic action,
was esteemed in conduct, and complaint was silenced in
order that vengeance could strike the more surely and
heavily. Under a tranquil, indifferent mien were concealed
the boldest and most deep-laid plans, and the
real intention first came to light in the decisive moment.
On the whole, there was certainly an impress of rigidity,
insensibility and self-goodness stamped upon the popular
character, but this stamp was more upon the outside
than in its innermost character, more the result of
inordinate prudence than of an evil disposition; and
through all its failings there shines forth a dignity of
soul which ennobled power and held up glory in this
life and in after ages as the highest object of human
undertakings.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>The part assigned to the Norsemen in the grand
drama of European history was to free the human mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>from the Cæsarian thraldom of Rome, in which it had
so long been chained; to show what marvels self-government
and free institutions can accomplish, and thus
hand down to us, their descendants, a glorious heritage
of imperishable principles, which we must study and in
a great measure be guided by.</p>

<p class='c004'>We retain in the days of the week the remembrance
of this religion, which was brought to England more
than fourteen hundred years ago by the Goths, who
came to give that country a new name and a new fate
in the world. The Goths taught the people of Britain
to divide tho week into their <i>Sun</i>-day, <i>Moon</i>-day, <i>Tys</i>-day,
<i>Odin’s</i>-day, <i>Thor’s</i>-day, and <i>Frey’s</i> or <i>Freyja’s</i>-day.
The name of Saturday the English owe to the Roman
god Saturnus; but the last day of the week was known
among the early Norsemen, and is still known among
them, as <i>Laugar</i>-dag, <i>Lör</i>-dag, that is <i>Washing</i>-day. It
is possible, as <abbr class='spell'>E. C.</abbr> Otté quaintly remarks, that our
Anglo-Saxon forefathers may have wished to change
this name when, in later times, they had ceased to have
only <i>one</i> washing-day out of the seven, like their
northers ancestors.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are now prepared to present the Norse mythology,
and we shall divide it into three divisions: <span class='sc'>The
Creation and Preservation, The Life and Exploits
Of the Gods</span>, and <span class='sc'>Ragnarok and Regeneration</span>.
These three divisions we dedicate respectively
to <span class='sc'>Urd</span>, <span class='sc'>Verdande</span>, and <span class='sc'>Skuld</span>, the three norns, <span class='sc'>Was</span>,
<span class='sc'>Is</span>, and <span class='sc'>Shall Be</span>, which uphold the world’s structure

<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='1'>I</abbr>. THE ORIGINAL CONDITION OF THE WORLD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The condition of things before the creation of the
world is expressed negatively. There was nothing
of that which sprang into existence. This transition
from empty space into being demands the attention of
the whole human race. Therefore the vala, or wandering
prophetess, begins her mysterious song, the grand
and ancient Völuspá, the first lay in the Elder Edda,
as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Give ear</div>
      <div class='line'>All ye divine races,</div>
      <div class='line'>Great and small,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sons of Heimdal!</div>
      <div class='line'>I am about to relate</div>
      <div class='line'>The wonderful works of Valfather,</div>
      <div class='line'>The oldest sayings of men,</div>
      <div class='line'>The first I remember.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It was Time’s morning</div>
      <div class='line'>When Ymer lived:</div>
      <div class='line'>There was no sand, no sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>No cooling billows;</div>
      <div class='line'>Earth there was none,</div>
      <div class='line'>No lofty heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Only Ginungagap,</div>
      <div class='line'>But no grass.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The beginning was this: Many ages, ere the earth
was made, there existed two worlds. Far to the north
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>was Niflheim (the nebulous world), and far to the south
was Muspelheim (the fire world). Between them was
Ginungagap (the yawning gap). In the middle of
Niflheim lay the spring called Hvergelmer, and from it
flowed twelve ice-cold streams, the rivers Elivagar, of
which Gjol was situated nearest Hel-gate. Muspelheim
was so bright and hot that it burned and blazed and
could not be trodden by those who did not have their
home and heritage there. In the midst of this intense
light and burning heat sat Surt, guarding its borders
with a flaming sword in his hand.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. THE ORIGIN OF THE GIANTS (RHIMTHURSAR).</h4>
<p class='c006'>The first beings came into existence in the following
manner: When those rivers that are called Elivagar,
and which flowed from the spring Hvergelmer, had
flowed far from their spring-head the venom which
flowed with them hardened, as does dross that runs
from a furnace, and became ice. And when the ice
stood still, and ran not, the vapor arising from the
venom gathered over it and froze to rime, and in this
manner were formed in the yawning gap many layers
of congealed vapor piled one over the other. That part
of Ginungagap that lay toward the north was thus
filled with thick and heavy ice and rime, and everywhere
within were fogs and gusts; but the south side
of Ginungagap was lightened by the sparks and flakes
that flew out of Muspelheim. Thus while freezing
cold and gathering gloom proceeded from Niflheim,
that part of Ginungagap which looked toward Muspelheim
was hot and bright; but Ginungagap was as
light as windless air; and when the heated blast met
the frozen vapor it melted into drops, <i>and by the might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>of him who sent the heat</i>,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> these drops quickened into
life and were shaped into the likeness of a man. His
name was Ymer, but the frost-giants called him Aurgelmer.
Ymer was not a god; he was bad (evil, <i>illr</i>),
as were all his kind. When he slept, he fell into a
sweat, and from the pit of his left arm waxed a man
and a woman, and one of his feet begat with the other
a son, from whom descend the frost-giants, and therefore
Ymer is called the old frost-giant (Rhimthurs).

      <div class='line'>Of that wise giant,</div>
      <div class='line'>A six-headed son.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. THE ORIGIN OF THE COW AUDHUMBLA AND THE BIRTH OF THE GODS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>On what did the giant Ymer live, is a pertinent
question. Here is the answer: The next thing, when
the rime had been resolved into drops, was that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>cow, which is called Audhumbla, was made of it. Four
milk-rivers ran out of her teats, and thus she fed Ymer.
On what did the cow feed? She licked rime-stones,
which were salt; and the first day that she licked the
stones there came at evening out of the stones a man’s
hair, the second day a man’s head, and the third day
all the man was there. His name was Bure. He was
fair of face, great and mighty. He begat a son by name
Bor. Bor took for his wife a woman whose name was
Bestla, a daughter of the giant Bolthorn, and they had
three sons, Odin, Vile and Ve, the rulers of heaven and
earth; and Odin, adds the Younger Edda, is the greatest
and lordliest of all the gods.</p>

<p class='c004'>The frost-giants were, then, the first race or the
first dynasty of gods. The Elder Edda makes this dynasty
embrace three beings, for Aurgelmer in the passage
quoted is the same as Ymer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin descended from the frost-giants, which is also
proved by a passage in the Younger Edda, where Ganglere
asks where Odin kept himself ere heaven and earth
were yet made. Then he was, answered Haar, with the
frost-giants (Rhimthursar).</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='4'>IV</abbr>. THE NORSE DELUGE AND THE ORIGIN OF HEAVEN AND EARTH.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Bor’s sons, Odin, Vile and Ve, slew the giant Ymer,
but when he fell there ran so much blood out of his
wounds, that with that they drowned all the race of
the frost-giants, save one, who got away with his household;
him the giants call Bergelmer. He went on board
his boat, and with him went his wife, and from them
came a new race of frost-giants. Thus the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Winters past counting,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere earth was yet made,</div>
      <div class='line'>Was born Bergelmer:</div>
      <div class='line'>Full well I remember</div>
      <div class='line'>How this crafty giant</div>
      <div class='line'>Was stowed safe in his skiff.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Odin, Vile and Ve dragged the body of Ymer into
the middle of Ginungagap, and of it they formed the
earth. From Ymer’s blood they made the seas and
waters; from his flesh the land; from his bones the
mountains; from his hair the forests, and from his
teeth and jaws, together with some bits of broken bones,
they made the stones and pebbles. From the blood that
ran from his wounds they made the vast ocean, in the
midst of which they fixed the earth, the ocean encircling
it as a ring; and hardy, says the Younger Edda, will
he be who attempts to cross those waters. Then they
took his skull and formed thereof the vaulted heavens,
which they placed over the earth, and set a dwarf at
the corner of each of the four quarters. These dwarfs
are called East, West, North, and South. The wandering
sparks and red-hot flakes that had been cast out
from Muspelheim they placed in the heavens, both above
and below Ginungagap, to give light unto the world.
The earth was round without and encircled by the deep
ocean, the outward shores of which were assigned as a
dwelling for the race of giants. But within, round
about the earth, the sons of Bor raised a bulwark
against turbulent giants, employing for this structure
Ymer’s eye-brows. To this bulwark they gave the name
Midgard.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> They afterwards threw and scattered the
brains of Ymer in the air, and made of them the melancholy
clouds. Thus the Elder Edda, in the lay of
Vafthrudner:</p>

<p class='c006'>The heavenly bodies were formed of the sparks from
Muspelheim. The gods did not create them, but only
placed them in the heavens to give light unto the world,
and assigned them a prescribed locality and motion. By
them days and nights and seasons were marked. Thus

</div>

<p class='c009'>Mundilfare was the father of the sun and moon. It
is stated in the Younger Edda that Mundilfare had two
children, a son and a daughter, so lovely and graceful
that he called the boy Maane<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> (moon) and the girl Sol
(sun), and the latter he gave in marriage to Glener (the
shining one).</p>

<p class='c004'>But the gods, being incensed at Mundilfare’s presumption,
took his children and placed them in the heavens,
and let Sol drive the horses that draw the car of the
sun. These horses are called Aarvak (the ever-wakeful)
and Alsvinn (the rapid one); they are gentle and beautiful,
and under their withers the gods placed two skins filled
with air to cool and refresh them, or, according to
another ancient tradition, an iron refrigerant substance
called <i>ísarnkol</i>. A shield, by name Svalin (cool), stands
before the Sun, the shining god. The mountains and
the ocean would burn up if this shield should fall away.
Maane was set to guide the moon in her course, and
regulate her increasing and waning aspect.</p>

<p class='c004'>A giant, by name Norve, who dwelt in Jotunheim,
had a daughter called Night (<i>nótt</i>), who, like all her
race, was of a dark and swarthy complexion. She was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>first wedded to a man called Naglfare, and had by him
a son named Aud, and afterward to another man called
Annar, by whom she had a daughter called Earth (<i>jörd</i>).
She finally espoused Delling (day-break), of asa-race,
and their son was Day (<i>dagr</i>), a child light and fair like
his father. Allfather gave Night and Day two horses
and two cars, and set them up in the heavens that they
might drive successively one after the other, each in
twenty-four hours’ time, round the world. Night rides
first with her steed Hrimfaxe (rime-fax),<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a> that every
morn, as he ends his course, bedews the earth with the
foam from his bit. The steed driven by Day is called
Skinfaxe (shining-fax), and all the sky and earth glistens
from his mane. Thus the Elder Edda, in the lay of

<p class='c009'>The sun speeds at such a rate as if she feared that
some one was pursuing her for her destruction. And
well she may; for he that seeks her is not far behind,
and she has no other way to escape than to run before
him. But who is he that causes her this anxiety?
There are two wolves; the one, whose name is Skol,
pursues the sun, and it is he that she fears, for he shall
one day overtake and devour her. The other, whose
name is Hate Hrodvitneson, runs before her and as
eagerly pursues the moon, that will one day be caught
by him. Whence come these wolves? Answer: A
giantess dwells in a wood called Jarnved (ironwood).
It is situated east of Midgard, and is the abode of a
race of witches. This old hag is the mother of many
gigantic sons, who are all of them shaped like wolves,
two of whom are Skol and Hate. There is one of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>race who is the most formidable of all. His name is
Maanagarm (moon-swallower): he is filled with the life-blood
of men who draw near their end, and he will
swallow up the moon, and stain the heavens and the
earth with blood. As it is said in the Völuspá, of the
Elder Edda:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The gods set Evening and Midnight, Morning and
Noon, Forenoon and Afternoon, to count out the year.
There were only two seasons, summer and winter; hence
spring and fall must be included in these two. The
father of summer is called Svasud (the mild), who is
such a gentle and delicate being, that what is mild is
from him called sweet (<i>sváslegt</i>). The father of winter
has two names, Vindlone and Vindsval (the wind-cool);
he is the son of Vasud (sleet-bringing), and, like all his
race, has an icy breath and is of grim and gloomy
aspect.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whence come the winds, that are so strong that
they move the ocean and fan fire to flame, and still are
so airy that no mortal eye can discern them? Answer:
In the northern extremity of the heavens sits a giant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>called Hræsvelger (corpse-swallower), clad with eagles’
plumes. When he spreads out his wings for flight, the
winds arise from under them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Which is the path leading from earth to heaven?
The gods made a bridge from earth to heaven and called
it Bifrost (the vibrating way). We have all seen it and
call it the rainbow. It is of three hues and constructed
with more art than any other work. But though strong
it be, it will be broken to pieces when the sons of Muspel,
after having traversed great rivers, shall ride over
it. There is nothing in nature that can hope to make
resistance when the sons of Muspel sally forth to the
great combat. Now listen to the Elder Edda on some
of these subject.</p>

<p class='c009'>In reference to Maane, it should be added, that the
Younger Edda tells us, that he once took children from
earth. Their names were Bil and Hjuke. They went
from the spring called Byrger, and bore on their shoulders
the bucket called Sæger with the pole called Simul.
Their father’s name was Vidfin. These children follow
Maane, as may be seen, from the earth.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='6'>VI</abbr>. THE GOLDEN AGE. THE ORIGIN OF THE DWARFS. THE CREATION OF THE FIRST MAN AND WOMAN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In the beginning Allfather (Odin) appointed rulers
and bade them judge with him the fate of men and
regulate the government of the celestial city. They met
for this purpose in a place called Idavold (the plains of
Ida), which is the center of the divine abode (Asgard,
the abode of the asas). Their first work was to erect
a court or hall, where there are twelve seats for themselves,
besides the throne which is occupied by Allfather.
This hall is the largest and most magnificent
in the universe, being resplendent on all sides both
within and without with the finest gold. Its name is
Gladsheim (home of gladness). They also erected another
hall for the sanctuary of the goddesses. It is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>fair structure and is called Vingolf (friends’-floor).
Thereupon they built a smithy and furnished it with
hammers, tongs and anvils, and with these made all
other requisite instruments with which they worked in
metals, stone and wood, and composed so large a quantity
of the metal called gold, that they made all their
house-furniture of it. Hence that age was called the
Golden Age. This was the age that lasted until the
arrival of the women out of Jotunheim, who corrupted it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then the gods seating themselves upon their thrones
distributed justice, and remembered how the dwarfs had
been bred in the mould of the earth, just as worms in
a dead body. The dwarfs were quickened as maggots
in the flesh of the old giant Ymer, but by the command
of the gods they received the form and understanding
of men; their abode was, however, in the
earth and rocks. Four dwarfs, Austre (east), Vestre
(west), Nordre (north), and Sudre (south), were appointed
by the gods to bear up the sky. Of the race
of dwarfs Modsogner and Durin are the principal ones.</p>

<p class='c004'>There were not yet any human beings upon the earth,
when one day, as the sons of Bor (Odin, Hœner and
Loder) were walking along the sea-beach, they found two
trees and created from them the first human pair, man
and woman. Odin gave them life and spirit, Hœner
endowed them with reason and the power of motion,
and Loder gave them blood, hearing, vision and a fair
complexion. The man they called Ask, and the woman
Embla. The newly created pair received from the gods
Midgard as their abode; and from Ask and Embla is
descended the whole human family. Thus the Elder
Edda, in Völuspá.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='7'>VII</abbr>. THE GODS AND THEIR ABODES.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In the Old Norse language a god is called <i>áss</i> (<abbr title='plural'>pl.</abbr>
<i>æsir</i>) and a goddess <i>ásynja</i>. The gods dwell in Asgard.
In its midst are the plains of Ida (<i>Idavöllr</i>, the assembling-place
of the gods), and Odin’s high-seat Hlidskjalf,
from where he looks out upon all the worlds.
But above the heaven of the asas are higher heavens,
and in the highest stands the imperishable gold-roofed
hall Gimle, which is brighter than the sun.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gods, to whom divine honors must be rendered,
are twelve in number, and their names are Odin, Thor,
Balder, Tyr, Brage, Heimdal, Hoder, Vidar, Vale, Uller,
Forsete, Loke. In this list Njord and Frey are not
mentioned, for they originally belonged to the vans or
sea-gods, and were received among the asas by virtue
of a treaty in which Njord was given as a hostage, and
Frey is his son.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of goddesses we find the number twenty-six, and
Vingolf is their hall. Odin’s hall is the great Valhal.
Spears support its ceiling; it is roofed with shields, and
coats of mail adorn its benches. Thither and to Vingolf
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Odin invites all men wounded by arms or fallen
in battle. Therefore he is called Valfather (father of
the slain), and his invited guests are called einherjes.
They are waited upon by valkyries.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dwelling of Thor is Thrudvang or Thrudheim.
His hall, the immense Bilskirner. Uller, Thor’s son,
lives in Ydaler. Balder lives in Breidablik, where nothing
impure is found. Njord, one of the vans, dwells
in Noatun by the sea. Heimdal inhabits Himinbjorg,
which stands where Bifrost’s bridge approaches heaven.
Forsete has Glitner for his dwelling, whose roof of silver
rests on golden columns. The chief goddess Frigg, wife
of Odin, has her dwelling-place in Fensal, and Freyja,
the goddess of love, dwells in Folkvang; her hall is Sessrymner.
Saga dwells in the great Sokvabek under the
cool waves; there she drinks with Odin every day from
golden vessels.</p>

<p class='c004'>We have so far mentioned the following classes of
deities: giants, gods, goddesses, vans (sea-deities), and
dwarfs. In addition to these the Younger Edda mentions
two kinds of elves: elves of light and elves of
darkness. The elves of light dwell in Alfheim (home
of the elves), but the elves of darkness live under the
earth, and differ from the others still more in their actions
than in their appearance. The elves of light are
fairer than the sun, but the elves of darkness blacker
than pitch.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then we have a lot of inferior spirits, such as trolls,
hulder, witches (<i>vœttr</i>), nisses, necks, etc., all of which
figure extensively in the Norse folk-lore, but an extensive
description of them will not be attempted in this
work.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='8'>VIII</abbr>. THE DIVISIONS OF THE WORLD.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Nine worlds are mentioned: Muspelheim, Asaheim,
Ljosalfaheim, Vanaheim, Mannaheim, Jotunheim, Svartalfaheim,
Helheim, Niflheim. The highest is Muspelheim
(the fire-world), the realm of Surt, and in its
highest regions it appears that Gimle (heaven) was
thought to be situated. The lowest is Niflheim (the
mist-world), the realm of cold and darkness, and in its
midst is the fountain Hvergelmer, where the dragon
Nidhug dwells. Between the two is Mannaheim (the
world of man) or Midgard, the round disk of the
earth, surrounded by the great ocean. The gods gave
Ask and Embla, the first human pair, and their descendants,
this world to dwell in. Far above Mannaheim
is Asaheim (the world of the gods), forming a
vault above the earth. In the midst of this world is
Idavold, the assembling-place of the gods, and here is
also Odin’s lofty throne Hlidskjalf. Beyond the ocean
is Jotunheim (the world of the giants). This world is
separated from Asaheim by the river Ifing, which never
freezes over. Nearest above the earth is Ljosalfaheim
(the world of the light elves), and between it and Asaheim
is Vanaheim (the world of the vans). Proceeding
downward, we come first to Svartalfaheim (world of
the dark elves), below Mannaheim, and between Svartalfaheim
and Niflheim we have Helheim (the world of
the dead, hell). Thither the way from the upper worlds
led down by the north through Jotunheim over the
stream Gjol, the bridge over which, called Gjallar-bridge,
was roofed over with shining gold.</p>

  <h3 id='chap1-2' class='c007'>CHAPTER II. <br /> THE PRESERVATION. <br /> THE ASH YGDRASIL. MIMER’S FOUNTAIN. URD’S FOUNTAIN. THE NORNS OR FATES.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Ygdrasil is one of the noblest conceptions that
ever entered into any scheme of cosmogony or
human existence. It is in fact the great tree of life,
wonderfully elaborated and extended through the whole
system of the universe. It furnishes bodies for mankind
from its branches; it strikes its roots through all worlds,
and spreads its life-giving arms through the heavens.
All life is cherished by it, even that of serpents, which
devour its roots and seek to destroy it. It has three
grand roots far apart. One of them extends to the
asas, another to the giants in that very place where
was formerly Ginungagap, and the third stands over
Niflheim, and under this root, which is constantly
gnawed by the serpent Nidhug and all his reptile
brood, is the fountain Hvergelmer. Under the root
that stretches out toward the giants is Mimer’s fountain,
in which wisdom and wit lie hid. The owner of
this fountain is called Mimer. He is full of wisdom,
because he drinks the waters of the fountain every
morning with the Gjallarhorn. Once Odin came and
begged a draught of this water, which he received, but
he had to leave one of his eyes in pawn for it. Thus
it is recorded in the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Full well I know,</div>
      <div class='line'>Great Odin, where</div>
      <div class='line'>Thine eye thou lost;</div>
      <div class='line'>In Mimer’s well,</div>
      <div class='line'>The fountain pure,</div>
      <div class='line'>Mead Mimer drinks</div>
      <div class='line'>Each morning new,</div>
      <div class='line'>With Odin’s pledge.</div>
      <div class='line'>Conceive ye this?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Under the root of Ygdrasil, which extends to the
asas in heaven, is the holy Urdar-fountain. Here the
gods sit in judgment. Every day they ride up hither
on horseback over Bifrost (the rainbow), which is called
the bridge of the gods (<i>ásbrú</i>). Odin rides his gray
eight-footed Sleipner, Heimdal on Goldtop. The other
horses are Glad (bright), Gyller (gilder), Gler (the
shining one), Skeidbrimer (fleet-foot), Silfrintop (silver
top), Siner (sinews), Gisl (the sunbeam), Falhofner (pale
hoof), Letfet (light-foot). It has been stated before
that the gods worthy of divine honors were twelve, and
here we have ten horses named. Balder’s and Thor’s
are wanting. Balder’s horse was burnt with his master’s
body, and as for Thor, he has to go on foot. He
cannot pass the Asabridge, for the thunder, which he is,
would destroy it; therefore he daily wades through the
rivers Kormt, Ormt, and two others called Kerlaug, to
get to the council of the gods.</p>

<p class='c004'>The giants cannot pass the Asabridge, for the red in
it is burning fire and the waters of heaven roar around
it. If it were easy for every one to walk over it, the
giants would go up to heaven by that bridge, and
perhaps succeed in bringing ruin upon the gods.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the Urdar-fountain dwell also three maidens,
named Urd, Verdande and Skuld (Present, Past and
Future). These maidens fix the lifetime of all men,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>and are called norns. They guard the fountain, which
takes its name from the first and highest of the three,
Urd (Urdar-fount). Besides these there are other norns,
some of which are of heavenly origin, but others belong
to the races of elves and dwarfs. The norns
who are of good origin are good themselves, and dispense
good destinies. Those men to whom misfortunes
happen ought to ascribe them to the evil
norns. Thus it is that some men are fortunate and
wealthy, while others acquire neither riches nor honors;
some live to a good old age, while others are cut off in
their prime.</p>

<p class='c004'>Furthermore it must be stated of the ash Ygdrasil,
that on its topmost bough sits an eagle who knows
many things, and between the eagle’s eyes sits a hawk
by name Vedfolner. A squirrel, whose name is Ratatosk,
runs up and down the tree, and seeks to cause strife
between the eagle and the serpent Nidhug. Four stags
leap about beneath its branches and feed on its buds.
They are called Daain, Dvalin, Duneyr, and Durathror.
But there are so many snakes with Nidhug in the fountain
Hvergelmer, that no tongue can count them. Thus
the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The tree Ygdrasil</div>

      <div class='line'>Nidhug gnaws below.</div>
    </div>

      <div class='line'>More serpents lie</div>
      <div class='line'>Under Ygdrasil’s ash</div>
      <div class='line'>Than simpletons think of;</div>

      <div class='line'>Gnaw the roots of that tree.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The norns, who dwell by the Urdar-fount, every day
draw water from this spring, and with it, and the clay
that lies around the fount, they sprinkle the ash, in
order that the boughs may continue green, and not rot
and wither away. This water is so holy that everything
placed in the spring becomes as white as the film within
an egg-shell. Thus the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>An ash know I standing</div>
      <div class='line'>Named Ygdrasil,</div>
      <div class='line'>A stately tree sprinkled</div>

<p class='c009'>The dew that falls from the tree on the earth men
call honey-dew, and it is the food of the bees. Finally,
two swans swim in the Urdar-fountain, and they are the
parents of the race of swans. Thus all the tribes of
nature partake of the universal tree.</p>

  <h3 id='chap1-3' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. <br /> EXEGETICAL REMARKS UPON THE CREATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE WORLD.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In the Norse as in all mythologies, the beginning
of creation is a cosmogony presenting many questions
difficult of solution. The natural desire of knowledge
asks for the origin of all things; and as the
beginning always remains inexplicable, the mind tries
to satisfy itself by penetrating as far into the primeval
forms of matter and means of sustaining life as possible.
We follow the development of the tree back to the
seed and then to the embryo of the seed, but still we
are unable to explain how a miniature oak can exist in
scarcely more than a mere point in the acorn. We even
inspect the first development of the plant with the
microscope, but we acquire knowledge not of the force,
but only of its manifestations or phenomena. Such was
also the experience of our ancestors, when they inquired
into the origin of this world. They had the same desire
to know, but were not so well provided with means of
finding out, as we are with our microscopic, telescopic,
and spectrum analysis instruments.</p>

<p class='c004'>The first effort of the speculative man is to solve the
mystery of existence. The first question is: How has
this world begun to be? What was in the beginning,
or what was there before there yet was anything? In
the Greek mythology many forms seem to arise out of
night, which seems to shroud them all. Thus in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Norse mythology the <i>negative</i> is the first, a <i>conditio
sine qua non</i>, space we might say, which we must conceive
of as existing, before anything can be conceived as
existing in it. Our ancestors imagined in the beginning
only a yawning gap in which there was absolutely nothing.
Wonderfully enough they said that the one side
of this immense gulf extended to the north and the
other to the south, as though there could be such things
as <i>north</i> and <i>south</i> before the creation of the world.
The north side was cold, the south warm; and thus we
find by closer inspection that this nothing still was
something, that contained in itself opposite forces, cold
and heat, force of contraction and force of expansion,
but these forces were in a state of absolute inertia.
Thus also the Greek chaos:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... rudis indigestaque moles,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nec quidquam nisi pondus iners, congestaque eodem</div>
      <div class='line'>Non bone junctarum discordia semina rerum.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We cannot conceive how a body containing two
forces can be a <i>pondus iners</i>, for every force is infinite
and cannot rest unless it is prisoned by its opposite
force, and this is then strife. The Norse view is, philosophically
speaking, more correct. Here the opposite
forces are separated by a gulf, and as they cannot penetrate
the empty space, they remain inert.</p>

<p class='c004'>It has before been stated that the Norsemen believed
in a great and almighty god, who was greater than Odin.
This god appears in the creation of the world, where
he sends the heated blasts from Muspelheim and imparts
life to the melted drops of rime. He will appear again
as the just and mighty one, who is to reign with Balder
in the regenerated earth. He is the true Allfather.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the thought was directed to inquire into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>origin of the world, one question would naturally suggest
another, thus:</p>

<p class='c004'>Question: What produced the world? Answer: The
giant Ymer.</p>

<p class='c004'>Question: But on what did the giant Ymer live?
Answer: On the milk of a cow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Question: What did the cow live on? Answer: On
salt.</p>

<p class='c004'>Question: Where did the salt come from? Answer:
From the rime.</p>

<p class='c004'>Question: Whence came the rime? Answer: From
ice-cold streams.</p>

<p class='c004'>Question: Whence came the cold? Answer: From
Niflheim.</p>

<p class='c004'>Question: But what gave life to the rime? Answer:
The heat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Question: Whence came the heat? Answer: From
him who sent it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here inquiry could go no further. This process
brought the inquirer to the god whom he dared not
name, the author and ruler of all things. This unknown
god thus appears only before the creation and after
the fall of the world. He is not a god of time but of
eternity. He is from everlasting to everlasting.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Elder Edda calls Ymer, Aurgelmer, father of
Thrudgelmer and grandfather of Bergelmer (Berggel-mer.)
The first syllables of these words express the
gradual hardening of matter from <i>aur</i> (loose clay) to
<i>thrud</i> (packed, compressed, strong clay), and finally to
<i>berg</i> (rock). Ymer, that is, the first chaotic world-mass,
is produced by the union of frost and fire. The
dead cold matter is quickened by the heat into a huge
shapeless giant, which has to be slain; that is, the crude
matter had to be broken to pieces before it could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>remodeled into the various forms which nature since has
assumed. This living mass, Ymer, produces many beings
like himself, frost-cold, stone-like, shapeless frost-giants
and mountain giants (icebergs and mountains). In these
forms evil is still predominant. All are allied to the
world of cold and darkness. It is only the lower, the
physical, world-life which moves in them.</p>

<p class='c004'>But a better being, although of animal nature,—the
cow Audhumbla—came into existence from the frozen
vapor, as the nurse of Ymer. This power nourishes
the chaotic world, and at the sane time calls forth by
its refining agency—by licking the rime-clumps—a
higher spiritual life, which unfolds itself through several
links—through Bure, the bearing (father), and Bor,
the born (son)—until it has gained power sufficient to
overcome chaotic matter—to kill Ymer and his offspring.
This conquering power is divinity itself, which
now in the form of a trinity goes forth as a creative
power—as spirit, will and holiness, in the brothers Odin,
Vile and Ve. The spirit quickens, the will arranges,
and holiness banishes the impure and evil. It is however
only in the creation of the world that these three
brothers are represented as coöperating. Vile and Ve
are not mentioned again in the whole mythology. They
are blended together in the all-embracing, all-pervading
world-spirit Odin, who is the essence of the world, the
almighty god.</p>

<p class='c004'>This idea of a trinity appears twice more in the
Norse mythology. In the gylfaginning of the Younger
Edda, Ganglere sees three thrones, raised one above the
other, and a man sitting on each of them. Upon his
asking what the names of these lords might be, his guide
answered: He who sitteth on the lowest throne is a
king, and his name is Haar (the high or lofty one);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the second is Jafnhaar (equally high); but he who
sitteth on the highest throne is called Thride (the
third). Then in the creation of man the divinity appears
in the form of a trinity. The three gods, Odin,
Hœner, and Loder, create the first human pair, each
one imparting to them a gift corresponding to his
own nature. Odin (<i>önd</i>, spirit) gives them spirit, the
spiritual life; he is himself the spirit of the world,
of which man’s is a reflection. Hœner (light) illuminates
the soul with understanding (<i>ódr</i>). Loder (fire,
<abbr title='german'>Germ.</abbr> <i>lodern</i>, to flame) gives the warm blood and
the blushing color, together with the burning keenness
of the senses. It is evident that Odin’s brothers on
these occasions are mere emanations of his being; they
proceed from him, and only represent different phases
of the same divine power. Loder is probably the
same person as afterwards steps forward as an independent
divinity by name Loke. When he was united
with Odin in the trinity he sends a quiet, gentle and
invisible flame of light through the veins of Ask and
Embla, that is of mankind. Afterwards, assuming the
name of Loke, he becomes the consuming fire of the
earth. Loder produces and develops life; Loke corrupts
and destroys life.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the creation the elements are separated. Ymer’s
body is parceled out; organic life begins. But the
chaotic powers, though conquered, are not destroyed;
a giant escapes in his ark with his family, and from
them comes a new race of giants. Disturbing and
deadly influences are perceptible everywhere in nature,
and these influences are represented by the hostile
dispositions of the giants toward the asas and of
their struggles to destroy the work of the latter. The
giants have been forced to fly to Jotunheim, to Utgard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>to the outermost deserts beyond the sea; but
still they manage to get within Midgard, the abode of
man, and here they dwell in the rugged mountains,
in the ice-clad jokuls and in the barren deserts, in
short, everywhere where any barrenness prevails. Their
agency is perceptible in the devastating storms caused
by the wind-strokes of Hræsvelger, the giant eagle in
the North; it is felt in winter’s cold, snow and ice,
and in all the powers of nature which are unfriendly
to fruitfulness and life.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The golden age of the gods, when</div>
      <div class='line'>On the green they played</div>
      <div class='line'>In joyful mood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor knew at all</div>
      <div class='line'>The want of gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until there came</div>
      <div class='line'>Three giant maids</div>
      <div class='line'>From Jotunheim,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>represents the golden age of the child and the childhood
of the human race. The life of the gods in its different
stages of development resembles the life of men.
Childhood innocent and happy, manhood brings
with it cares and troubles. The gods were happy
and played on the green so long as their development
had not yet taken any decided outward direction;
but this freedom from care ended when they
had to make dwarfs and men, and through them got
a whole world full of troubles and anxieties to provide
for and protect,—just as the golden age ends for the
child when it enters upon the activities of life, and
for the race, when it enters into the many complications
and cares of organized society. The gods played with
pieces of gold. The pure gold symbolizes innocence.
These pieces of gold (<i>gullnar töflur</i>) were lost, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>were found again in the green grass of the regenerated
earth. From the above it must be clear that
the three giant maids, who came from Jotunheim
and put an end to the golden age, must be the norns,
the all-pervading necessity that develops the child into
manhood. It does not follow, therefore, that these
maids were giantesses, for the gods themselves <i>descended</i>
from the giants. Nor did the norns introduce evil into
the world, but they marked out for the gods a career
which could not be changed; and immediately after
the appearance of the maids from Jotunheim the gods
must create man, whose fate those same norns would
afterwards determine.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gods did not create the dwarfs, but only determined
that they were to have the form and understanding
of men.</p>

<p class='c004'>Man was made of trees—of the ash and the elm.
There is something graceful in this idea. The Norse
conception certainly is of a higher order than those
which produce man from earth or stones. It is more
natural and more noble to regard man as having been
made of trees, which as they grow from the earth
heavenward show an unconscious attraction to that
which is divine, than, as the Greeks do, to make men
stand forth out of cold clay and hard stones. We confess
that the Norse myth looks Greek and the Greek
looks Norse; yet there may be a good reason for it.
The plastic Greek regarded man as a statue, which
generally was formed of clay or stone, but to which a
divine spark of art gave life. The Norsemen knew not
the plastic art and therefore had to go to nature, and
not to art, for their symbols. The manner in which
Odin breathes spirit and life into the trees reminds us
very forcibly of the Mosaic narrative. It is interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>to study the various mythological theories in regard to
the origin of man. The inhabitants of Thibet have a
theory that undoubtedly is of interest to the followers
of Darwin. In Thibet the three gods held counsel as
to how Thibet might be peopled. The first one showed
in a speech that the propagation of the human race
could not be secured unless one of them changed himself
into an ape. The last one of the three gods did
this, and the goddess Kadroma was persuaded to change
herself into a female ape. The plan succeeded, and they
have left a numerous offspring.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Various classes of beings are mentioned in the mythology.
Life is a conflict between these beings, for the
spiritual everywhere seeks to penetrate and govern the
physical; but it also everywhere meets resistance. The
asas rule over heaven and earth, and unite themselves
with the vans, the water divinities. The giants war
with the asas and vans. The elves most properly belong
to the asas, while the dwarfs are more closely
allied to the giants, but they serve the asas. The most
decided struggle, then, is between the asas and giants.</p>

<p class='c004'>The spiritual and physical character of the giants is
clearly brought out in the myths. They constitute a
race by themselves, divided into different groups, but
have a common king or ruler. Their bodies are of
superhuman size, having several hands and heads.
Sterkodder had six arms; Hymer had many heads, and
they were hard as stones; Hrungner’s forehead was
harder than any kettle. The giantesses are either horribly
ugly or charmingly beautiful. As the offspring
of darkness, the giants prefer to be out at night. The
sunlight, and especially lightning, terrifies them. On
land and sea they inhabit large caves, rocks and mountains.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Their very nature is closely allied to stones and
mountains. When Brynhild drove in a chariot on the
way to Hel, and passed through a place in which a
giantess dwelt, the giantess said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thou shalt not</div>
      <div class='line'>Pass through</div>
      <div class='line'>My stone-supported</div>
      <div class='line'>Dwelling-place.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The weapons of the giants, as the following myths will
show, were stones and rocks; they had clubs and shields
of stone. Hrungner’s weapons were flint-stones. The
giants also have domesticated animals. The giant
Thrym sat on a mound plaiting gold bands for his
greyhounds and smoothing the manes of his horses.
He had gold-horned cows and all-black oxen. They
possess abundance of wealth and treasures.</p>

<p class='c004'>The giant is old, strong and powerful, very knowing
and wise, but also severe, proud and boasting. The
giantess is violent, passionate and impertinent. In their
lazy rest the giants are good-natured; they may be as
happy as children; but they must not be teased.</p>

<p class='c004'>The giants representing the wild, disturbing, chaotic
forces in nature, the beneficent gods can subdue or control
them in two ways: The one is to kill them and use
their remains for promoting the fruitfulness of the earth,
the other is to unite with them, in other words, to marry
them. This forms the subject of a large number of
myths, which, when we have formed a correct general
conception of the giants, need no further explanation.
Odin kills Sokmimer, the destructive maelstrom of the
ocean. Thor crushes Hrungner, the barren mountain.
Odin marries Gunlad, Njord marries Skade, Frey marries
Gerd, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the Odinic mythology was superseded by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Christian religion it left a numerous offspring of elves,
trolls (dwarfs), nisses, necks, mermaids, princes, princesses,
etc., all of which still live in the memory and
traditions of Scandinavia. They may be said to belong
to the fairy mythology of these countries. We give a
brief sketch of these objects of popular belief, chiefly
from the excellent work of Thomas Keightley. A general
knowledge of them is necessary in order to appreciate
the rich folk-lore literature of Norseland.</p>

<p class='c004'>The elves still retain their distinction into <i>white</i> and
<i>black</i>. The white or good elves dwell in the air, dance
on the grass, or sit in the leaves of trees; the black or
evil elves are regarded as an underground people, who
frequently inflict sickness or injury on mankind, for
which there is a particular kind of doctors and doctresses
in most parts of Scandinavia. The elves are
believed to have their kings, and to celebrate their
weddings and banquets, just the same as the dwellers
above ground. There is an interesting intermediate class
of them called in popular tradition hill-people (<i>haugafolk</i>),
who are believed to dwell in caves and small
hills. When they show themselves they have a handsome
human form. The common people seem to connect
with them a deep feeling of melancholy, as if
bewailing a half-quenched hope of salvation. Their
sweet singing may occasionally be heard on summer
nights out of their hills, when one stands still and
listens, or, as it is expressed in the ballads, lays his ear
to the elf-hill; but no one must be so cruel as by the
slightest word to destroy their hopes of salvation, for
then the spritely music will be turned into weeping
and lamentation. The Norsemen usually call the elves
<i>hulder</i> or <i>huldrefolk</i>, and their music <i>huldreslaat</i>. It
is in the minor key, and of a dull and mournful sound.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>Norse fiddlers sometimes play it, being thought to have
learned it by listening to the underground people among
the hills and rocks. There is also a tune called the elfkings’
tune, which several of the good fiddlers know
right well, but never venture to play, for as soon as it
begins both old and young, and even inanimate objects,
are compelled to dance, and the player cannot stop unless
he can play the air backwards, or that some one comes
behind him and cuts the strings of his fiddle. Ole Bull
and Thorgeir Andunson, the people think, learned to
play the fiddle from the hill-people. The little underground
elves, who are thought to dwell under the houses
of mankind, are described as sportive and mischievous,
and as imitating all the actions of men. They are said
to love cleanliness about the house and place, and to
reward such servants as are neat and cleanly.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dwarfs have become trolls. They are not generally
regarded as malignant. They are thought to live
inside of hills, mounds and mountains; sometimes in
single families, sometimes in societies. They figure
extensively in the folk-lore. They are thought to be
extremely rich, for when on great occasion of festivity
they have their hills raised up on red pillars, people
that have chanced to be passing by have seen them
shoving large chests full of money to and fro, and
opening and clapping down the lids of them. Their
dwellings are very magnificent inside, being decorated
with gold and crystal. They are obliging and neighborly,
freely lending and borrowing and otherwise keeping up
a friendly intercourse with mankind. But they have a
sad propensity to stealing, not only provisions, but also
women and children. Trolls have a great dislike to
noise, probably from the recollection of the time when
Thor used to be flinging his hammer after them, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>this would indicate that the giants are their true ancestors.
The hanging of bells in the churches has for this
reason driven the most of them out of the country.</p>

<p class='c004'>The nisse is the German kobold and the Scotch
brownie. He seems to be of the dwarf family, as he
resembles them in appearance, and like them has plenty
of money and a dislike to noise and tumult. He is of
the size of a year-old child, but has the face of an old
man. His usual dress is gray, with a pointed red cap,
but on Michaelmas day he wears a round hat like those
of the peasants. No farm-house goes on well unless
there is a nisse in it, and well it is for the maids and
the men when they are in favor with him. They may
go to their beds and give themselves no trouble about
their work, and yet in the morning the maids will find
the kitchen swept and water brought in, and the men
will find the horses in the stable well cleaned and curried,
and perhaps a supply of corn cribbed for them
from the neighbor’s barns. But he punishes them for
any irregularity that takes place.</p>

<p class='c004'>The neck is the river-spirit. Sometimes he is represented
as sitting during the summer nights on the
surface of the water, like a pretty little boy with golden
hair hanging in ringlets, and a red cap on his head;
sometimes as above the water, like a handsome young
man, but beneath like a horse; at other times as an
old man with a long beard, out of which he wrings the
water as he sits on the cliffs. The neck is very severe
against any haughty maiden who makes an ill return
to the love of her wooer; but should he himself fall in
love with a maid of human kind, he is the most polite
and attentive suitor in the world. The neck is also a
great musician; he sits on the water and plays on his
gold harp, the harmony of which operates on all nature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>To learn music of him, a person must present him with
a black lamb and also promise him resurrection and
redemption.</p>

<p class='c004'>The stromkarl, called in Norway <i>grim</i> or <i>fosse-grim</i>
(force-grim), is a musical genius like the neck. He
who has learned from him can play in such a masterly
manner that the trees dance and waterfalls stop at his
music.</p>

<p class='c004'>The merman is described as of a handsome form
with green or black hair and beard. He dwells either
in the bottom of the sea or in cliffs near the sea-shore,
and is regarded as rather a good and beneficent kind
of being.</p>

<p class='c004'>The mermaid (<i>haffrue</i>) is represented in the popular
tradition sometimes as good, at other times as evil and
treacherous. Her appearance is beautiful. Fishermen
sometimes see her in the bright summer’s sun, when a
thin mist hangs over the sea, sitting on the surface of
the water, and combing her long golden hair with a
golden comb, or driving up her snow-white cattle to
feed on the strands or small islands. At other times
she comes as a beautiful maiden, chilled and shivering
with the cold of the night, to the fires the fishermen
have kindled, hoping by this means to entice them to
her love. Her appearance prognosticates both storm and
ill success in their fishing. People that are drowned,
and whose bodies are not found, are believed to be taken
into the dwellings of the mermaids.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is the prevalent opinion among the common people
of the North that all these various beings were once
worsted in a conflict with superior powers, and condemned
to remain until doomsday in certain assigned
abodes. The rocks were given to the dwarfs; the groves
and leafy trees to the elves; the caves and caverns to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>hill-people; the sea, lakes and rivers to the merman,
mermaids and necks; and the small forces (waterfalls)
to the fossegrims. Both the Catholic and Protestant
priests have tried to excite an aversion to these beings,
but in vain. They still live and fill the fairy-tales and
folk-lore with their strange characters, and are capable
of furnishing a series of unrivaled subjects for the
painter and sculptor. These weird stories are excellently
adapted to adorn our epic and dramatic poetry as
well as our historic novels. But they must be thoroughly
understood first, not only by the poet, but also by his
reader. Thomas Keightley, from whom we have given
a short abstract, has given us an excellent work in
English on Gothic fairy mythology, and we would
recommend our readers to read his work in connection
with Dr. Dasent’s <i>Tales from the Fjeld</i>. <i>We</i> have to
present the original mythology, not its offspring.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ygdrasil is a most sublime and finished myth. It is
a symbol uniting all the elements of mythology into a
poetical system. The tree symbolizes, and extends its
roots and branches into, the whole universe. Its roots
are gnawed by serpents, and stags bite its branches, but
the immortal tree still stands firm and flourishes from
age to age. The Norsemen’s whole experience of life is
here presented in a picture that either in regard to beauty
or depth of thought finds no equal in all the other systems
of mythology. Thomas Carlyle says: I like too that
representation they (the Norsemen) have of the tree
Ygdrasil: all life is figured by them as a tree. Ygdrasil,
the Ash-tree of Existence, has its roots deep down in the
kingdom of <i>Hela</i>, or Death; its trunk reaches up heaven-high,
spreads its boughs over the whole universe. It
is the Tree of Existence. At the foot of it, in the Death-kingdom,
sit three <i>Nornas</i> (fates),—the Past, Present,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Future,—watering its roots from the Sacred Well. Its
boughs, with their buddings and disleafings—events,
things suffered, things done, catastrophes,—stretch
through all lands and times. Is not every leaf of it a
biography, every fiber there an act or word? Its boughs
are histories of nations; the rustle of it is the noise of
human existence, onwards from of old. It grows there,
the breath of human passion rustling through it; or
storm-tost, the storm-wind howling through it like the
voice of all the gods. It is Ygdrasil, the Tree of Existence.
It is the past, the present, and the future; what
was done, what is doing, what will be done; the infinite
conjugation of the verb <i>to do</i>. Considering how human
things circulate, each inextricably in communion with
all,—how the word I speak to you to-day is borrowed,
not from Ulfila, the Mæso-Goth only, but from all men
since the first man began to speak,—I find no similitude
so true as this of a tree. Beautiful altogether, beautiful
and great. The machine of the universe! Alas, do but
think of that in contrast!</p>

<p class='c004'>The name Ygdrasil is derived from Odin’s name,
<i>Yggr</i> (the deep thinker), and <i>drasill</i> (carrier, horse).
Ygdrasil, therefore, means the <i>Bearer of God</i>, a phrase
which finds a literal explanation when Odin hangs nine
nights on this tree before he discovered the runes.
Thus the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I know that I hung</div>
      <div class='line'>Nine whole nights,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to Odin offered,</div>
      <div class='line'>On that tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>From what root it springs.</div>
      <div class='line'>On a wind-rocked tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a spear wounded,</div>
      <div class='line'>Myself to myself,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of which no one knows.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>All the tribes of nature partake of this universal tree,
from the eagle who sits on the topmost bough down
through the different stages of animal life; the hawk in
the lower strata of air, the squirrel who busily leaps
about in the branches, the stags by the fountain, to the
serpents beneath the surface of the earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>The peculiar feature of this myth is its comprehensiveness.
How beautiful the sight of a large tree! Its
far-extending branches, its moss-covered stem, its high
crown and deep roots, remind us of the infinity of time;
it has seen ages roll by before we were born. In the
evening, when our day’s work is done, we lie down in its
broad shade and think of the rest that awaits us when
all our troubles are ended. Its leaves rustle in the
breezes and the sunshine; they speak to us of that which
is going on above this sorrow-stricken earth. But the
tree is not the whole symbol. It is connected with the
great waters, with the clear fountain with its egg-white
waves, and with the turbulent streams that flow in the
bowels of the earth. While the calm firmness of the tree
and the monotonous rustling of the wind through its
leaves invites the soul to rest, the ceaseless activity of the
various tribes of animals that feed upon its roots and
branches remind us of nature never at rest and never
tiring. The tree sighs and groans beneath its burden;
the animals move about in it and around it; every species
of animals has its place and destination; the eagle soars
on his broad wings over its top; the serpent winds his
slimy coils in the deep; the swan swims in the fountain;
and while all the tribes of animated life are busily
engaged, the dew-drops fall to refresh and cool the earth
and the heart of man. Nay, this is not all. There is
one who has planted the tree, and there are many who
watch and care for it; higher beings protect it. Gods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>and men, all that possesses life and consciousness, has its
home in this tree and its work to do. The norns constantly
refresh it with water from the Urdar-fountain;
the elves hover about it; Heimdal suspends his tri-colored
arch beneath it; the glory of Balder shines upon
it; Mimer lifts his head in the distance, and the pale
Hel watches the shades of men who have departed this
earth and journey through the nine worlds over Gjallarbro
to their final rewards. The picture is so grand that
nothing but an infinite soul can comprehend it; no brush
can paint it, no colors can represent it. Nothing is quiet,
nothing at rest; all is activity. It is the whole world,
and it can be comprehended only by the mind of man,
by the soul of the poet, and be symbolized by the ceaseless
flow of language. It is not a theme for the painter
or sculptor, but for the poet. Ygdrasil is the tree of
experience of the Gothic race. It is the symbol of a
great race, sprung originally from the same root but
divided into many branches, Norsemen, Englishmen,
Americans, etc. It has three roots, and experience has
taught the Goths that there are in reality but three kinds
of people in the world: some that work energetically for
noble and eternal purposes, and their root is in Asaheim;
some that work equally energetically, but for evil and
temporal ends, and their root is in Jotunheim; and many
who distinguished themselves only by sloth and impotence,
and their root is in Niflheim with the goddess Hel
or death, in Hvergelmer, where the serpent Nidhug, with
all his reptile brood, gnaws at their lives. Thus the
Gothic race is reflected in Ygdrasil, and if our poets will
study it they will find that this grand myth is itself in
fact a root in the Urdar-fountain, and from it may spring
an Ygdrasil of poetry, extending long branches throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the poetical world and delighting the nations of the
earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Beneath that root of Ygdrasil, which shoots down
to Jotunheim, there is a fountain called after its watcher
<i>Mimer’s Fountain</i>, in which wisdom and knowledge are
concealed. The name Mimer means the <i>knowing</i>. The
giants, being older than the asas, looked deeper than
the latter into the darkness of the past. They had
witnessed the birth of the gods and the beginning of
the world, and they foresaw their downfall. Concerning
both these events, the gods had to go to them for knowledge,
an idea which is most forcibly expressed in the
Völuspá, the first song in the Elder Edda, where a vala,
or prophetess, from Jotunheim is represented as rising
up from the deep and unveiling the past and future to
gods and men. It is this wisdom that Mimer keeps in
his fountain. Odin himself must have it. In the night,
when the sun has set behind the borders of the earth,
he goes to Jotunheim. Odin penetrates the mysteries
of the deep, but he must leave his eye in pawn for the
drink which he receives from the fountain of knowledge.
But in the glory of morning dawn, when the sun rises
again from Jotunheim, Mimer drinks from his golden
horn the clear mead which flows over Odin’s pawn.
Heaven and this lower world mutually impart their
wisdom to each other.</p>

<p class='c004'>The norns watch over man through life. They
spin his thread of fate at his birth and mark out with
it the limits of his sphere of action in life. Their decrees
are inviolable destiny, their dispensations inevitable
necessity. The gods themselves must bow before
the laws of the norns; they are limited by time; they
are born and must die. Urd and Verdande, the Past
and Present, are represented as stretching a web from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>east to west, from the radiant dawn of life to the glowing
sunset, and Skuld, the Future, tears it to pieces.
There is a deeply-laid plan in the universe, a close
union between spirit and matter. There is no such
thing as independent life or action. The ends of the
threads wherewith our life is woven lie deeply hid in
the abyss of the beginning. Self-consciousness is merely
an abstraction. The self-conscious individual is merely
a leaf, which imagines itself to be something, but is in
fact only a bud that enfolds itself and falls off from
the tree of the universe. The self-contradiction between
absolute necessity and free will was an unsolved riddle
with our heathen ancestors, and puzzles the minds of
many of our most profound thinkers still. Thus, says
the Elder Edda, the norns came to decide the destiny
of Helge Hundingsbane:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nay, in the Norseman’s faith, man and all things
about him were sustained by divine power. The norns
decreed by rigid fate each man’s career, which not even
the gods could alter. Man was free to act, but all the
consequences of his actions were settled beforehand.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first and eldest of the asas is Odin. His name
is derived from the verb <i>vada</i> (imperfect <i>ód</i>), to
walk, (compare watan, wuot, wuth, wüthen, wuothan,
wodan). He is the all-<i>pervading</i> spirit of the world,
and produces life and spirit (<i>önd</i>, <i>aand</i>). He does not
create the world, but arranges and governs it. With
Vile and Ve he makes heaven and earth from Ymer’s
body; with Hœner and Loder he makes the first man
and woman, and he gives them spirit. All enterprise in
peace and in war proceeds from him. He is the author
of war and the inventor of poetry. All knowledge
comes from him and he is the inventor of the runes.
As the spirit of life he permeates all animate and inanimate
matter, the whole universe; he is the infinite
wanderer. He governs all things, and although the
other deities are powerful they all serve and obey him
as children do their father. He confers many favors
on gods and men. As it is said in the Elder Edda, in
the lay of Hyndla:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Especially are the heroes constantly the object of
his care. He guides and protects the brave hero through
his whole life; he watches over his birth and over his
whole development; gives him wonderful weapons,
teaches him new arts of war; assists him in critical
emergencies, accompanies him in war, and takes the
impetus out of the enemy’s javelins; and when the
warrior has at last grown old, he provides that he may
not die upon his bed, but fall in honorable combat.
Finally, he protects the social organization and influences
the human mind. He revenges murder, protects
the sanctity of the oath, subdues hatred, and dispels
anxieties and sorrows.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. ODIN’S NAMES.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Odin is called Allfather, because he is the father of
all the gods, and Valfather (father of the slain), because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>he chooses for his sons all who fall in combat. For
their abode he has prepared Valhal and Vingolf, where
they are called einherjes (heroes). In Asgard, Odin
has twelve names, but in the Younger Edda forty-nine
names are enumerated, and if to these are added all the
names by which the poets have called him, the number
will reach nearly two hundred. The reason for his
many names, says the Younger Edda, is the great variety
of languages. For the various nations were obliged
to translate his name into their respective tongues in
order that they might supplicate and worship him.
Some of his names, however, are owing to adventures
that have happened to him on his journeys and which
are related in old stories. No one can pass for a wise
man who is not able to give an account of these wonderful
adventures.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. ODIN’S OUTWARD APPEARANCE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>In appearance, Odin is an old, tall, one-eyed man
with a long beard, a broad-brimmed hat, a striped cloak
of many colors, and a spear in his hand. On his arm
he wears the gold ring Draupner, two ravens sit on his
shoulders, two wolves lie at his feet, and a huge chariot
rolls above his head. He sits upon a high throne and
looks out upon the world, or he rides on the winds
upon his horse Sleipner. There is a deep speculative
expression on his countenance. In the Volsung Saga,
Odin is revealed as follows: King Volsung had made
preparations for an entertainment. Blazing fires burned
along the hall, and in the middle of the hall stood a
large tree, whose green and fair foliage covered the roof.
(This reminds us of Ygdrasil.) King Volsung had
placed it there, and it was called Odin’s tree. Now as
the guests sat around the fire in the evening, a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>entered the hall whose countenance they did not know.
He wore a variegated cloak, was bare-footed, his breeches
were of linen, and a wide-brimmed hat hung down
over his face. He was very tall, looked old, and was
one-eyed. He had a sword in his hand. The man
went to the tree, struck his sword into it with so powerful
a blow that it sunk into it even to the hilt. No
one dared greet this man. Then said he: He who
draws this sword out of the trunk of the tree shall
have it as a gift from me, and shall find it true that
he never wielded a better sword. Then went the old
man out of the hall again, and no one knew who he
was or whither he went. Now all tried to draw the
sword out, but it would not move, before Volsung’s son,
Sigmund, came; for him it seemed to be quite loose.
Farther on in the Saga Sigmund had become king,
and had already grown old when he waged war with
King Lynge. The norns protected him so that he could
not be wounded. In a battle with Lynge there came a
man to Sigmund, wearing a large hat and blue cloak.
He had but one eye, and had a spear in his hand.
The man swung his spear against Sigmund. Sigmund’s
sword broke in two, luck had left him, and he fell. The
same Saga afterwards tells us that Sigmund’s son, Sigurd,
sailed against the sons of Hunding, on a large
dragon. A storm arose, but Sigurd commanded that
the sails should not be taken down, even though the
wind should split them, but rather be hoisted higher.
As they passed a rocky point, a man cried to the ship
and asked who was the commander of the ships and
men. They answered that it was Sigurd Sigmundson,
the bravest of all young men. The man said, all agree
in praising him; take in the sails and take me on
board! They asked him for his name. He answered:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Hnikar they called me, when I gladdened the raven
after the battle; call me now Karl, from the mountain,
Fengr or Fjolner, but take me on board! They laid
to and took him on board. The storm ceased and they
sailed until they came to the sons of Hunding; then
Fjolner (Odin) disappeared. In the same Saga he also
comes to Sigurd in the garb of an old man with long
flowing beard, and teaches him how to dig ditches by
which to capture Fafner.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='4'>IV</abbr>. ODIN’S ATTRIBUTES.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Odin’s hat represents the arched vault of heaven,
and his blue or variegated cloak is the blue sky or
atmosphere, and both these symbolize protection.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin’s ravens, Hugin (reflection) and Munin (memory),
have been mentioned before. They are perched
upon his shoulders and whisper into his ears what they
see and hear. He sends them out at daybreak to fly
over the world, and they come back at eve toward meal-time.
Hence it is that Odin knows so much and is
called Rafnagud (raven-god). Most beautifully does Odin
express himself about these ravens in Grimner’s lay,
in the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hugin and Munin</div>
      <div class='line'>Fly each day</div>
      <div class='line'>Over the spacious earth.</div>
      <div class='line'>I fear for Hugin</div>
      <div class='line'>That he come not back,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet more anxious am I for Munin.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And in Odin’s Raven-song, Hug (Hugin) goes forth to
explore the heavens. Odin’s mind, then, is the flying
raven; he is the spiritual ruler.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin has two wolves, Gere and Freke (the greedy
one and the voracious one). Odin gives the meat that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>is set on his table to these two wolves; for he himself
stands in no need of food. Wine is for him both meat
and drink. Thus the Elder Edda, in Grimner’s lay:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gere and Freke</div>
      <div class='line'>Feeds the war-faring,</div>
      <div class='line'>Triumphant father of hosts;</div>
      <div class='line'>For ’tis with wine only</div>
      <div class='line'>That Odin in arms renowned</div>
      <div class='line'>Is nourished forever.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To meet a wolf is a good omen. Odin amusing himself
with his wolves is an exquisite theme for the sculptor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin had a ring called Draupner. We find its history
in the conversations of Brage, the second part of
the Younger Edda. Loke had once out of malice cut
all the hair off Sif, the wife of Thor. But when Thor
found this out he seized Loke and would have crushed
every bone in him if he had not sworn to get the elves
of darkness to make golden hair for Sif, that would grow
like other hair. Then went Loke to the dwarfs, that are
called Ivald’s sons, and they made the hair, and Skidbladner
(Frey’s ship), and the spear that Odin owned and
is called Gungner. Then Loke wagered his head with
the dwarf, whose name is Brok, that his brother, Sindre,
would not be able to make three more treasures as good
as those three just named. The brothers went to the
smithy. Sindre put a pig-skin in the furnace and bade
Brok blow the bellows and not stop before Sindre took
that out of the furnace which he had put into it. A fly
set itself on Brok’s hand and stung him, but still he
continued blowing the bellows, and that which Sindre
took out was a boar with golden bristles. Then Sindre
put gold into the furnace. This time the fly set itself
on Brok’s neck, and stung him worse, but he continued
blowing the bellows, and that which the smith took out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>was the gold ring Draupner (from the verb meaning <i>to
drop</i>). The third time Sindre put iron in the furnace,
and bade his brother be sure to continue blowing or
all would be spoiled. Now the fly set itself between
his eyes and stung his eye-lids. The blood ran down
into his eyes, so that he could not see; then Brok let
go of the bellows just for a moment to drive the fly
away. That which the smith now took out was a hammer.
Sindre gave his brother these treasures and bade
him go to Asgard to fetch the wager. As now Loke
and Brok came each with his treasures, the asas seated
themselves upon their thrones and held consult, and
Odin, Thor and Frey were appointed judges who should
render a final decision. Then Loke gave Odin the
spear, which never would miss its mark; Thor he gave
the hair, which immediately grew fast upon Sif’s head;
and to Frey he gave the ship, which always got fair
wind as soon as the sails were hoisted, no matter where
its captain was going, and it could also be folded as a
napkin and put into the pocket, if this were desirable.
Thereupon Brok came forward and gave Odin the ring,
and said that every ninth night a ring equally heavy
would drop from it. To Frey he gave the boar, and said
that it could run in the air and on the sea, night and
day, faster than any horse, and the night never was so
dark, nor the other worlds so gloomy, but that it would
be light where this boar was present, so bright shone
its bristles. To Thor he gave the hammer, and said
that with it he might strike as large an object as he
pleased; it would never fail, and when he threw it he
should not be afraid of losing it, for no matter how
far it flew it would always return into his hand, and
at his wish it would become so small that he might
conceal it in his bosom, but it had one fault, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>was that the handle was rather short. According to the
decision of the gods, the hammer was the best of all
the treasures, and especially as a protection against the
frost-giants; they accordingly decided that the dwarf
had won the wager. The latter now wanted Loke’s head.
Loke offered to redeem it in some way, but the dwarf
would accept no alternatives. Well take me then, said
Loke, and in a moment he was far away, for he had
shoes with which he could run through the air and over
the sea. Then the dwarf asked Thor to seize him,
which was done; but when the dwarf wanted to cut his
head off, Loke said: The head is yours, but not the neck.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
Then took the dwarf thread and knife and wanted to
pierce Loke’s lips, so as to sew his lips together, but the
knife was not sharp enough. Now it were well, if I
had my brother’s awl, said he, and instantaneously the
awl was there, and it was sharp. Then the dwarf
sewed Loke’s lips together. (The dwarfs are here represented
as smiths of the gods.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The ring Draupner is a symbol of fertility. Odin
placed this ring on Balder’s funeral pile and it was
burnt with Balder (the summer), and when Balder sent
this ring back to Odin, his wife, the flower-goddess
Nanna, sent Frigg, the wife of Odin, a carpet (of
grass), which represents the return of vegetation and
fruitfulness. Balder sends the ring back as a memento
of the fair time when he and his father (Odin) worked
together, and reminds the father of all, that he must
continue to bless the earth and make it fruitful. But
this is not all; this ring also symbolizes the fertility of
the mind, the creative power of the poet, the evolution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>of one thought from the other, the wonderful chain of
thought. The rings fell from Draupner as drop falls
from drop. Ideas do not cling fast to their parent, but
live an independent life when they are born; and the
idea or thought, when once awakened, does not slumber,
but continues to grow and develop in man after man, in
generation after generation, evolving constantly new
ideas until it has grown into a unique system of
thought. If we, as our fathers undoubtedly did, make
this gold ring typify the historical connection between
times and events, a ring constantly multiplying and
increasing with ring interlinked with ring in time’s
onward march, what a beautiful golden chain there has
been formed from time’s morning until now!</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin had a spear called Gungner. The word means
producing a violent shaking or trembling, and it most
thoroughly shook whomsoever was hit by it. As has
been seen above, it was made by the sons of Ivald (the
dwarfs), and was presented to Odin by Loke. Odin
speeds forth to the field of battle with golden helmet,
resplendent armor, and his spear Gungner. Oath was
taken on the point of Gungner. This spear is frequently
referred to in the semi-mythological Sagas, where spears
are seen flying over the heads of the enemy; they are
panic-stricken and defeated. Spears are sometimes seen
as meteorical phenomena, showing that war is impending.
The spear symbolizes Odin’s strength and power.
When Odin’s spear was thrown over anybody, Odin
thereby marked him as his own. Did not Odin wound
himself with a spear, and thereby consecrate himself to
heaven? (See <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> <a href='#Page_254'>254</a>-261.) When Odin puts the spear
into the hands of the warrior, it means that he awakens
and directs his deeds of valor. When Odin is the god
of poetry and eloquence (Anglo-Saxon <i>wód</i>), then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>spear Gungner is the keen, stinging satire that can be
expressed in poetry and oratory.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin’s horse Sleipner (slippery) was the most excellent
horse. Runes were carved on his teeth. The following
myth gives us an account of his birth: When
the gods were constructing their abodes, and had already
finished Midgard and Valhal, a certain artificer came
and offered to build them, in the space of three half
years, a residence so well fortified that they should be
perfectly safe from the incursions of the frost-giants and
the giants of the mountains, even though they should
have penetrated within Midgard. But he demanded for
his reward the goddess Freyja, together with the sun and
moon. After long deliberation the gods agreed to his
terms, provided he would finish the whole work himself
without any one’s assistance, and all within the
space of one winter; but if anything remained unfinished
on the first day of summer, he should forfeit the
recompense agreed on. On being told these terms, the
artificer stipulated that he should be allowed the use
of his horse, called Svadilfare (slippery-farer), and this
by the advice of Loke was granted to him. He accordingly
set to work on the first day of winter, and during
the night let his horse draw stone for the building.
The enormous size of the stones struck the gods with
astonishment, and they saw clearly that the horse did
one half more of the toilsome work than his master.
Their bargain, however, had been concluded in the presence
of witnesses and confirmed by solemn oaths, for
without these precautions a giant would not have
thought himself safe among the gods, especially when
Thor returned from an expedition he had then undertaken
toward the east against evil demons.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the winter drew to a close, the building was far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>advanced, and the bulwarks were sufficiently high and
massive to render this residence impregnable. In short,
when it wanted but three days to summer, the only
part that remained to be finished was the gateway.
Then sat the gods on their seats of justice and entered
into consultation, inquiring of one another who among
them could have advised to give Freyja away to Jotunheim
or to plunge the heavens in darkness by permitting
the giant to carry away the sun and the moon.
They all agreed that none but Loke Laufeyarson and
the author of so many evil deeds could have given
such bad counsel, and that he should be put to a cruel
death if he did not contrive some way or other to prevent
the artificer from completing his task and obtaining
the stipulated recompense. They immediately proceeded
to lay hands on Loke, who in his fright promised upon
oath, that let it cost him what it would he would so
manage matters that the man should lose his reward.
That very night, when the artificer went with Svadilfare
for building-stone, a mare suddenly ran out of a
forest and began to neigh. The horse being thus
excited, broke loose and ran after the mare into the
forest, which obliged the man also to run after his
horse, and thus between one and the other the whole
night was lost, so that at dawn the work had not made
the usual progress. The man, seeing that he had no
other means of completing his task, resumed his own
gigantic stature, and the gods now clearly perceived
that it was in reality a mountain giant who had come
amongst them. No longer regarding their oaths, they
therefore called on Thor, who immediately ran to their
assistance, and lifting up his mallet Mjolner (the crusher)
that the dwarfs had made, he paid the workman his
wages, not with the sun and moon, and not even by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>sending him back to Jotunheim, for with the first blow
he shattered the giant’s skull to pieces, and hurled him
headlong into Niflheim. But Loke had run such a race
with Svadilfare, that shortly after the mischief-maker
(Loke) bore a gray foal with eight legs. This is the
horse Sleipner, which excels all horses ever possessed by
gods or men. The gods perjured themselves, and in
reference to this says the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then went the rulers there,</div>
      <div class='line'>All gods most holy,</div>
      <div class='line'>To their seats aloft,</div>
      <div class='line'>And counsel together took;</div>
      <div class='line'>Who all the winsome air</div>
      <div class='line'>With guile had blended,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or to the giant’s race</div>
      <div class='line'>Oder’s maiden given.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then Thor, who was there,</div>
      <div class='line'>Arose in wrathful mood,</div>
      <div class='line'>For seldom sits he still</div>
      <div class='line'>When such things he hears.</div>
      <div class='line'>Annulled were now all oaths,</div>
      <div class='line'>And words of promise fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>And faith not long before</div>
      <div class='line'>In council plighted.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This riddle is propounded. Who are the two who
ride to the Thing? Three eyes have they together, ten
feet and one tail; and thus they travel through the
lands. The answer is Odin, who rides on Sleipner; he
has one eye, the horse two; the horse runs on eight
feet, Odin has two; only the horse has a tail.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin’s horse, Sleipner, symbolizes the winds of
heaven, that blow from eight quarters. In Skaane and
Bleking, in Sweden, it was customary to leave a sheaf
of grain in the field for Odin’s horse, to keep him from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>treading down the grain. Wednesday is named after
Odin (Odinsday), and on this day his horse was most
apt to visit the fields. But in a higher sense Sleipner
is a Pegasos. Pegasos flew from the earth to the abodes
of the gods; Sleipner comes from heaven, carries the
hero unharmed through the dangers of life, and lifts
the poet, who believes in the spirit, up to his heavenly
home. Grundtvig calls Sleipner the courser of the poet’s
soul; that is to say, of the Icelandic or Old Norse
strophe in poetry, which consisted of eight verses, or four
octometers. The most poetic is the most truthful
interpretation of the myths.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='5'>V</abbr>. ODIN’S JOURNEYS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>A whole chapter might be written about the wanderings
of Odin, his visits to the giants, to men, to battles,
etc.; but as these records are very voluminous, and are
found to a great extent in the semi-mythological Sagas,
in which it is difficult to separate the mythical and historical
elements, we will make but a few remarks on this
subject. All his wanderings of course describe him as
the all-pervading spirit of the universe. They have the
same significance as his horse Sleipner, his ravens Hugin
and Munin, etc. He descends to the bottom of the sea
for wisdom, he descends to earth to try the minds of
men. In the Elder Edda journeys of Odin form the
subjects of the lays of Vafthrudner, Grimner, Vegtam,
etc. (See <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> <a href='#Page_120'>120</a>-124.) In the lay of Vafthrudner Odin
visits the giant Vafthrudner for the purpose of proving
his knowledge. They propose questions relating to the
cosmogony of the Norse mythology, on the condition
that the baffled party forfeit his head. The giant incurs
the penalty. Odin calls himself Gangraad, but by the last
question the giant recognizes him and is stricken with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>awe and fear. The giant must perish since he has ventured
into combat with Odin. The mind subdues physical
nature. When the giant recognizes Odin he realizes
his own depressed nature and must die. No rogue
can look an honest man in the eye.  In Grimnersmál
Odin assumes the name of Grimner, and goes to try the
mind of his foster-son Geirrod.  Geirrod tortures him and
places him between two fires.  And here begins the lay,
in which Odin glorifies himself and the power of the
gods and pities his fallen foster-son, but finally discloses
himself and declares death to Geirrod for his want of
hospitality.  Thus Odin closes his address to Geirrod in
the lay of Grimner:</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='6'>VI</abbr>. ODIN AND MIMER.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>In the lay of Vegtam, Odin goes to Hel, and wakes
the prophetess to learn the fate of his son Balder. He
also takes counsel from the utmost sources of the ocean,
and listens to the voice from the deep. Some myths
refer to Odin’s pawning his eye with Mimer, others to
his talking with Mimer’s head.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Younger Edda, having stated that Mimer’s well
is situated under that root of the world-ash Ygdrasil
that extends to Jotunheim, adds that wisdom and wit
lie concealed in it, and that Odin came to Mimer one
day and asked for a drink of water from the fountain.
He obtained the drink, but was obliged to leave one of
his eyes in pawn for it. To this myth refers the following
passage from the Völuspá in the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Alone she<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a> sat without,</div>

      <div class='line'>And in his eye she gazed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The vala to Odin:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of what wouldst thou ask me?</div>
      <div class='line'>Odin! I know all,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where thou thine eye didst sink</div>
      <div class='line'>In the pure well of Mimer.</div>

      <div class='line'>From Valfather’s pledge.</div>
      <div class='line'>Understand ye yet, or what?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This myth was given in connection with Ygdrasil,
but it is repeated here to shed a ray of light upon the
character of Odin, and in this wise Mimer is brought
into a clearer sunlight also.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>In regard to Odin’s speaking with Mimer’s head, we
have the following passage in the lay of Sigdrifa:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On the rock he<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> stood</div>
      <div class='line'>With edged sword,</div>
      <div class='line'>A helm on his head he bore.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Then spake Mimer’s head</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Its first wise word,</div>
      <div class='line'>And true sayings uttered.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And in Völuspá, when Ragnarok is impending:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Mimer’s sons dance,</div>

      <div class='line'><i>Odin speaks</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>With Mimer’s head</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Odin’s eye is the sun. Mimer’s fountain is the
utmost sources of the ocean. Into it, Odin’s eye, the
sun sinks every evening to search the secrets of the deep,
and every morning Mimer drinks the gold-brown mead
(aurora). When the dawn colors the sea with crimson
and scarlet, then Mimer’s white fountain is changed to
golden mead; it is then Mimer, the watcher of the
fountain of knowledge, drinks with his golden horn the
clear mead which flows over Odin’s pledge. But Mimer
means memory<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a> (Anglo-Saxon <i>meomor</i>), and as we know
that our ancestors paid deep reverence to the memories
of the past, and that the fallen heroes, who enjoyed the
happiness of Valhal with Odin, reveled in the memory
of their deeds done on earth, it is proper to add that
Mimer is an impersonation of memory. Our spirit
(Odin, <i>od</i>, <i>aand</i>) sinks down into the depths of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>past (memory, the sea, Odin’s fountain), and brings
back golden thoughts, which are developed by the
knowledge which we obtained from the depths beneath
the sea of past history and experience. What a vast
ocean is the history and experience of our race!</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='7'>VII</abbr>. HLIDSKJALF.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Hlidskjalf is Odin’s throne. The accounts of it are
very meagre. The Younger Edda speaks of a stately
mansion belonging to Odin called Valaskjalf, which was
built by the gods and roofed with pure silver, and in
which is the throne called Hlidskjalf. When Odin is
seated on this throne he can see over the whole world.
But he not only looks, he also listens.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

</div>

<p class='c009'>it is said in Odin’s Raven-song; in Grimner’s lay it
is stated that Odin and Frigg, his wife, were sitting in
Hlidskjalf, looking over all the world; and in the lay
of Skirner we read that Frey, son of Njord, had one
day seated himself in Hlidskjalf. As Odin every morning
sends out his ravens, it seems to be his first business,
as a good father, to look out upon the world that he
has made, and see how his children are doing, and
whether they need his providential care in any respect.
Hlidskjalf and Valhal must not be confounded. Valhal
will be explained hereafter. It is situated in Gladsheim,
where Odin sat with his chosen heroes and drank wine.
But Valaskjalf is a place apart from Gladsheim, and on
its highest pinnacle above the highest arches of heaven
is Odin’s throne, Hlidskjalf.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='8'>VIII</abbr>. THE HISTORICAL ODIN.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>We have now presented the mythological Odin as
based on the inscrutable phenomena of nature, and have
given some hints in regard to the ethical or anthropomorphic
element contained in each myth. Our next
subject will be Odin’s wives, their maid-servants, his sons,
etc.; but before we proceed to them we will give a short
outline of the historical Odin, as he is presented in the
Heimskringla of Snorre Sturleson by Saxo Grammaticus
and others. Mr. Mallet, the French writer on Northern
Antiquities, has given a synoptical view of all that these
writers have said about the wanderings and exploits of
this famous person, and we will make an abstract from
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Roman Empire had arrived at its highest point of
power, and saw all the then known world subject to its
laws, when an unforeseen event raised up enemies against
it from the very bosom of the forests of Scythia and on
the banks of the Tanais. Mithridates by flying had
drawn Pompey after him into those deserts. The king
of Pontus sought there for refuge and new means of
vengeance. He hoped to arm against the ambition of
Rome all the barbarous nations, his neighbors, whose
liberty she threatened. He succeeded in this at first, but
all those peoples, ill united as allies, poorly armed as
soldiers, and still worse disciplined, were forced to yield
to the genius of Pompey. Odin is said to have been of
this number. He was obliged to flee from the vengeance
of the Romans and to seek, in countries unknown to his
enemies, that safety which he could no longer find in
his own.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin commanded the Asas, whose country was situated
between the Pontus Euxinus and the Caspian Sea.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Their principal city was Asgard. Odin having united
under his banners the youth of the neighboring nations,
marched toward the west and north of Europe, subduing
all the peoples he met on his way and giving them to
one or other of his sons for subjects. Many sovereign
families of the North are said to be descended from these
princes. Thus Hengist and Horsa, the Saxon chiefs who
conquered Britain in the fifth century, counted Odin in
the number of their ancestors. So did also the other
Anglo-Saxon princes, as well as the greater part of the
princes of Lower Germany and the North.</p>

<p class='c004'>After having disposed of so many countries and confirmed
and settled his new governments, Odin directed
his course toward Scandinavia, passing through Holstein
and Jutland. These provinces made him no resistance.
Then he passed into Funen (Denmark), which
submitted as soon as he appeared. In this island he
remained for a long time and built the city of Odense
(<i>Odins-ve</i>, Odin’s sanctuary), which still preserves in its
name the memory of its founder. Hence he extended
his authority over all the North. He subdued the rest
of Denmark and placed his son Skjold upon its throne.
The  descendants of Skjold continued for many generations
to rule Denmark, and were called Skjoldungs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin, who seems to have been better pleased to give
crowns to his children than to wear them himself, afterwards
passed over into Sweden, where at that time ruled
a prince by name Gylfe, who paid him great honors and
even worshiped him as a divinity. Odin quickly acquired
in Sweden the same authority as he had obtained in
Denmark. The Swedes came in crowds to do him homage,
and by common consent bestowed the title of king
upon his son Yngve and his posterity. Hence sprung
the Ynglings, a name by which the kings of Sweden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>were for a long time distinguished. Gylfe died and was
forgotten; Odin acquired lasting fame by his distinguished
rule. He enacted new laws, introduced the
customs of his own country, and established at Sigtuna,
an ancient city in the same province as Stockholm, a
supreme council or tribunal, composed of twelve judges.
Their business was to watch over the public weal, to
distribute justice to the people, to preside over the new
worship, which Odin had brought with him into the
North, and to preserve faithfully the religious and magical
secrets which that prince deposited with them. He
levied a tax on every man throughout the country, but
engaged on his part to defend the inhabitants against
all their enemies and to defray the expense of the worship
rendered to the gods at Sigtuna.</p>

<p class='c004'>These great acquisitions seem not, however, to have
satisfied his ambition. The desire of extending further
his religion, his authority, and his glory, caused him to
undertake the conquest of Norway. His good fortune
followed him thither, and this kingdom quickly obeyed
a son of Odin named Sæming, who became the head of
a family the different branches of which reigned for a
long time in Norway.</p>

<p class='c004'>After Odin had finished these glorious achievements
he retired into Sweden, where, perceiving his end to
draw near, he would not wait for a lingering disease to
put an end to that life which he had so often and so
valiantly hazarded in the battle-field, but gathering round
him the friends and companions of his fortune, he gave
himself nine wounds in the form of a circle with the
point of a lance, and many other cuts in his skin with
his sword. As he was dying he declared he was going
back to Asgard to take his seat among the gods at an
eternal banquet, where he would receive with great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>honors all who should expose themselves intrepidly in
battle and die bravely with their swords in their hands.
As soon as he had breathed his last they carried his
body to Sigtuna, where, in accordance with a custom
introduced by him into the North, his body was burned
with much pomp and magnificence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such was the end of this man, whose death was
as extraordinary as his life. It has been contended by
many learned men that a desire of being revenged on
the Romans was the ruling principle of his whole conduct.
Driven by those enemies of universal liberty from
his former home, his resentment was the more violent,
since the Goths considered it a sacred duty to revenge
all injuries, especially those offered to their relations or
country. He had no other view, it is said, in traversing
so many distant kingdoms, and in establishing with so
much zeal his doctrines of valor, but to arouse all
nations against so formidable and odious a nation as
that of Rome. This leaven which Odin left in the
bosoms of the worshipers of the gods, fermented a long
time in secret; but in the fullness of time, the signal
given, they fell upon this unhappy empire, and, after
many repeated shocks, entirely overturned it, thus revenging
the insult offered so many ages before to their
founder.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Sagas paint Odin as the most persuasive of men.
Nothing could resist the force of his words. He sometimes
enlivened his harangues with verses, which he composed
extemporaneously, and he was not only a great
poet, but it was he who taught the art of poetry to the
Norsemen. He was the inventor of the runic characters,
which so long were used in the North. This marking
down the unseen thought that is in man with written
characters is the most wonderful invention ever made;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>it is almost as miraculous as speech itself, and well
may it be called a sort of second speech. But what
most contributed to make Odin pass for a god was his
skill in magic. He could run over the world in the
twinkling of an eye; he had the command of the air
and the tempests, he could transform himself into all
sorts of shapes, could raise the dead, could foretell
things to come, could by enchantments deprive his
enemies of health and strength and discover all the
treasures concealed in the earth. He knew how to
sing airs so tender and melodious, that the very plains
and mountains would open and expand with delight;
the ghosts, attracted by the sweetness of his songs,
would leave their infernal caverns and stand motionless
around him.</p>

<p class='c004'>But while his eloquence, together with his august
and venerable deportment, procured him love and respect
in a calm and peaceable assembly, he was no less
dreadful and furious in battle. He inspired his enemies
with such terror that they thought they could not describe
it better than by saying he rendered them blind
and deaf. He would appear like a wolf all desperate and
biting his very shield for rage, he would throw himself
amidst the opposing ranks, making around him the
most horrible carnage, without receiving any wound
himself. Such is the historical Odin of the North,
such was, in other words, the great example that the
Norsemen had to imitate in war and in peace.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='9'>IX</abbr>. ODIN’S WIVES.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Odin’s wives are Jord (Fjorgyn, Hlodyn), Rind and
Frigg. Heaven is married to earth. This we find in
all mythologies (Uranos and Gaia, Zeus and Demeter,
etc.) Among the Norsemen also the ruler of heaven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>and earth (Odin) enters into marriage relations with his
own handiwork. This relation is expressed in three
ways: Odin is married to Jord, to Frigg, and to Rind.
Jord is the original, uninhabited earth, or the earth
without reference to man; Frigg is the inhabited, cultivated
earth, the abode of man, and Rind is the earth
when it has again become unfruitful, when the white
flakes of winter have covered its crust; it is in this
latter condition that she long resists the loving embraces
of her husband. These three relations are expressed still
more clearly by their children. With Jord Odin begets
Thor, with Frigg Balder, and with Rind Vale. Jord
is the Greek Gaia, Frigg is Demeter, but the fortunate
Greeks had no goddess corresponding to Rind; they
knew not the severe Norse winter.</p>

<p class='c004'>Jord is sometimes called Fjorgyn and Hlodyn, but
neither of these names occur many times in the Eddas.
There are only found occasional allusions to her, such
as the flesh of Ymer, the daughter of Annar, sister of
Dag, mother of Thor, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frigg is the daughter of Fjorgyn and the first among
the goddesses, the queen of the asas and asynjes. Odin
is her dearly beloved husband. She sits with him in
Hlidskjalf and looks out upon all the worlds, and for
the death of their son, the light Balder, they mourn together
with all nature. Frigg knows the fate of men,
but she never says or prophesies anything about it herself.
She possesses a falcon-disguise, which Loke once
borrowed of her. She possesses a magnificent mansion
Fensal, where she sat weeping over Valhal’s misfortune
after the death of Balder. It is not certain whether
Friday is named after Frigg or Freyja or after Frey, but
the probabilities are that it is Freyja’s day (<i>dies Veneris</i>).
While Frigg and Freyja are by many authors confounded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>they are nevertheless wholly different characters. Frigg
is <i>asa</i>queen, Freyja is <i>vana</i>dis. Frigg is a <i>mother’s</i> love;
Freyja is the love of the <i>youth</i> or <i>maiden</i>. The asas
are land deities, the vans are divinities of the water.
The vana-goddess Freyja represents the surging, billowy,
unsettled love; the asynje Frigg represents love in its
nobler and more constant form.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='10'>X</abbr>. FRIGG’S MAID-SERVANTS.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Fulla, Hlyn, Gnaa, Snotra, Var, Lofn (Sjofn), and
Syn, are enumerated as maid-servants of Frigg.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fulla goes about with her hair flowing over her
shoulders and her head adorned with a golden ribbon.
She is intrusted with the toilette and slippers of Frigg
and admitted into the most important secrets of that
goddess. The word Fulla means full, fulness, and as
the servant of Frigg she represents the fulness of the
earth, which is beautifully suggested by her waving hair
and golden ribbon (harvest), and when Balder sent the
ring Draupner from Hel, his wife Nanna sent Frigg a
carpet, and Fulla a gold ring.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hlyn has the care of those whom Frigg intends to
deliver from peril.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gnaa is the messenger that Frigg sends into the
various worlds on her errands. She has a horse that
can run through air and water, called Hofvarpner (the
hoof-thrower). Once, as she drove out, certain vans
saw her car in the air, when one of them exclaimed:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What flies there?</div>
      <div class='line'>What goes there?</div>
      <div class='line'>In the air aloft what glides?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>She answered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I fly not, though I go,</div>
      <div class='line'>And glide through the air</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>On Hofvarpner,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose sire’s Hamskerper<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>And dame Gardrofa.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Gnaa is interpreted to mean the mild breezes, that
Frigg sends out to produce good weather.</p>

<p class='c004'>Var listens to the oaths that men take, and particularly
the troth plighted between man and woman,
and punishes those who keep not their promises. She
is wise and prudent, and so penetrating that nothing
remains hidden from her. Her name Var means <i>wary</i>,
careful.</p>

<p class='c004'>Lofn (<i>lofa</i>, <i>loben</i>, love) is so mild and gracious to those
who invoke her, that by a peculiar privilege which either
Odin himself or Frigg has given her, she can remove
every obstacle that may prevent the union of lovers
sincerely attached to each other. Hence her name is
applied to denote love, and whatever is beloved by
men.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sjofn delights in turning men’s hearts and thoughts
to love; hence love is called from her name <i>sjafni</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Syn keeps the door in the hall and shuts it against
those who ought not to enter. She presides at trials,
when anything is to be denied on oath; whence the
proverb, Syn (negation) is set against it, when anything
is denied.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='11'>XI</abbr>. GEFJUN, EIR.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The norns or destinies have been previously explained
(see <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_190'>190</a>); Nanna will be discussed in connection
with Balder, and Freyja, the goddess of love, in connection
with Njord and Frey; but there are besides
these a few other goddesses, who demand our attention
here.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Gefjun is a maid, and all those who die maids become
her hand-maidens. Of her there is the following anecdote
in the Younger Edda. King Gylfe ruled over the
land which is now called Sweden. It is related of him
that he once gave a wayfaring woman, as a recompense
for her having diverted him, as much land in his realm
as she could plow with four oxen in a day and a night.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
This woman was however of the race of the asas, and
was called Gefjun. She took four oxen from the North,
out of Jotunheim, (but they were the sons she had had
with a giant,) and set them before a plow. Now the
plow made such deep furrows that it tore up the land,
which the oxen drew westward out to the sea until they
came to a sound. There Gefjun fixed the land and called
it Zealand. And the place where the land had stood
became water, and formed a lake which is now called
Logrinn (the sea) in Sweden, and the inlets of this lake
correspond exactly with the headlands of Zealand in
Denmark. Thus saith the Skald, Brage:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gefjun drew from Gylfe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Rich in stored up treasure,</div>
      <div class='line'>The land she joined to Denmark.</div>
      <div class='line'>Four heads and eight eyes bearing,</div>
      <div class='line'>While hot sweat trickled down them,</div>
      <div class='line'>The oxen dragged the reft mass</div>
      <div class='line'>That formed this winsome island.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The etymology of Gefjun is uncertain. Some explain
it as being a combination of the Greek γῆ, and
Norse <i>fjón</i>, separation (<i>terræ separatio</i>). Grimm compares
it with the Old Saxon <i>geban</i>, Anglo-Saxon, <i>geofon</i>,
<i>gifan</i>, the ocean. Grundtvig derives it from Anglo-Saxon
<i>gefean</i>, gladness. He says it is the same word as
Funen (<i>Fyn</i>), and that the meaning of the myth is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Funen and Jutland with united strength tore Zealand
from Sweden. This would then be a historical interpretation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The derivation from <i>gefa</i>, to give, has also been suggested,
and there is no doubt that the plowing Gefjun is
the goddess of agriculture. She unites herself with the
giants (the barren and unfruitful fields or deserts) and
subdues them, thus preparing the land for cultivation.
In this sense she is Frigg’s maid-servant. Gefjun, the
plowed land, develops into Frigg, the fruit-bearing earth;
hence she is a maid, not a woman. The maid <i>is not</i>,
but <i>shall become</i> fruitful.</p>

<p class='c004'>Eir is the goddess of the healing art, and this is
about all that we know of her; but that is a great deal.
A healer for our frail body and for the sick mind!
what a beneficent divinity!</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='12'>XII</abbr>. RIND.</h4>
<p class='c006'>This goddess was mentioned in Section <abbr title='9'>IX</abbr>. It is
the third form of earth in its relation to Odin. Thus
the lay of Vegtam, in the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Rind a son shall bear</div>
      <div class='line'>In the wintry halls,</div>
      <div class='line'>He shall slay Odin’s son</div>
      <div class='line'>When one night old.</div>
      <div class='line'>He a hand will not wash,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor his hair comb,</div>

      <div class='line'>Balder’s adversary.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Odin’s repeated wooing of this maid is expressed in
Hávamál, of the Elder Edda, as follows:</p>

      <div class='line'>Heaped upon me;</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor of that damsel gained I aught.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This is clearly the same story as is related by Saxo
Grammaticus, as follows: Odin loves a maiden, whose
name is Rind, and who has a stubborn disposition.
Odin tried to revenge the death of his son Balder. Then
he was told by Rosthiof that he with Rind, the daughter
of the king of the Ruthenians, would beget another
son, who would revenge his brother’s death. Odin put
on his broad-brimmed hat and went into the service of
the king, and won the friendship of the king, for as
commander he put a whole army to flight. He revealed
his love to the king, but when he asked the maiden
for a kiss, she struck his ear. The next year he came
as a smith, called himself Rosterus, and offered the
maiden a magnificent bracelet and beautiful rings; but
she gave his ear another blow. The third time he came
as a young warrior, but she thrust him away from her
so violently that he fell head first to the ground.
Finally he came as a woman, called himself Vecha, and
said he was a doctress. As Rind’s servant-maid, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>washed her feet in the evening, and when she became
sick he promised to cure her, but the remedy was so
bitter that she must first be bound. He represented to
her father that it, even against her wish, must operate
with all its dissolving power, and permeate all her limbs
before she could be restored to health. Thus he won
the maiden, as some think, with the secret consent of
her father. But the gods banished Odin from Byzantium,
and accepted in his place a certain Oller, whom
they even gave Odin’s name. This Oller had a bone,
which he had so charmed by incantations that he could
traverse the ocean with it as in a ship. Oller was banished
again by the gods, and betook himself to Sweden;
but Odin returned in his divine dignity and requested
his son Bous, whom Rind bad borne, and who showed
a great proclivity for war, to revenge the death of his
brother. Saxo Grammaticus relates this as confidently
as if it were the most genuine history, not having the
faintest suspicion as to its mythical character.</p>

<p class='c004'>Saxo’s Rosthiof is mentioned in the Elder Edda as
Hross-thiofr (horse-thief), of Hrimner’s (the frost’s rime’s)
race. Saxo’s Vecha is Odin, who in the Elder Edda is
called Vak. The latter portion of the myth is not given
in Hávamál, and were it not for faithful Saxo we should
scarcely understand that portion of the Elder Edda which
was quoted above. But with the light that he sheds
upon it there is no longer any doubt. Rind is the earth,
not generally speaking, but the earth who after the death
of Balder is consigned to the power of winter. Does not
the English word <i>rind</i> remind us of the hard-frozen
crust of the earth? Defiantly and long she resists the
love of Odin; in vain be proffers her the ornaments of
summer; in vain he reminds her of his warlike deeds,
the Norseman’s most cherished enterprise in the summer-season.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>By his all-powerful witchcraft he must dissolve
and as it were melt her stubborn mind. Finally she
gives birth to Vale, the strong warrior.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the incantation of Groa, in the Elder Edda, this
is the first song that the mother sings to her son:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I will sing to thee first</div>
      <div class='line'>One that is thought most useful,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which Rind sang to Ran;<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>That from thy shoulders thou shouldst cast</div>
      <div class='line'>What to thee seems irksome:</div>
      <div class='line'>Let thyself thyself direct. (Be independent!)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What is it that seems so irksome to Rind and Ran,
and that both cast from their shoulders in order to
become independent? It is the ice. When Rind had
thrown it off she requested the sea-goddess Ran to do
likewise.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Greeks have a myth corresponding somewhat to
this. The god of the heavens, Zeus, comes down in the
rain into Hera’s lap; but when she resisted his entreaties
Zeus let fall a shower of rain, while she was sitting on
the top of a mountain, and he changed himself to a
nightingale (a symbol of spring-time). Then Hera compassionately
took the wet and dripping bird into her lap.
But look at the difference! Hera soon gives way and
pities, but our Norse Rind makes a desperate resistance.
It repeatedly looks as if Odin had conquered, but the
maid reassumes her stubborn disposition. How true this
is of the climate in the northern latitudes! Rind is not
inapplicable to our Wisconsin winters.</p>

<p class='c004'>Such is the physical interpretation of Odin’s relation
to Frigg and Rind. Heaven and earth are wedded
together; and upon this marriage earth presents itself in
two forms: fruitful and blest, unfruitful and imprisoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>in the chains of cold and frost. As the king of the year
Odin embraces both of them. But Odin is also the
spiritual (<i>aand</i>) king, who unites himself with the human
earthly mind. He finds it crude and uncultured, but
susceptible of impressions. Pure thoughts and noble
feelings are developed, which grow into blooming activities.
But then comes back again the unfeeling coldness
and defiant stubbornness which take possession of the
mind, shutting out the influence of truth upon the mind.
It is a sad time when doubt and skepticism and despair
every night lay their leaden weight upon the poor man’s
soul. However to the honest seeker of truth it is only
a transitory state of trial. A wise Providence takes him
with tender and patient hands again to his bosom. He
sends down showers of blessings or misfortunes upon
him. With his mild breath he melts the frozen heart,
and it at once clothes itself with garlands of divinest
hues. With all his charms he touches the wintry <i>rind</i>
that encases us, and the mind stands forth unmanacled
and free. What to the year is light summer and dark
winter is to us bright and gloomy periods of our existence,
that succeed each other in their turn, advancing
or impeding our spiritual development, which must continue
forever. This is also contained in the myth about
Odin and Rind, nay, it is the better half.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='13'>XIII</abbr>. GUNLAD. THE ORIGIN OF POETRY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Poetry is represented as an inspiring drink. He who
partakes of it is <i>skáld</i>, poet. This drink was kept with
the giants, where Gunlad protected it. Odin goes down
to the giants, conquers all obstacles, wins Gunlad’s affection,
and gets permission to partake of the drink. He
brings it to the upper world and gives it to men. Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>poetry originated and developed. Thus it is related in
the Younger Edda:</p>

<p class='c004'>Æger having expressed a wish to know how poetry
originated, Brage, the god of poetry, informed him that
the asas and vans having met to put an end to the war
which had long been carried on between them, a treaty
of peace was agreed to and ratified by each party spitting
into a jar. As a lasting sign of the amity which was
thenceforward to subsist between the contending parties,
the gods formed out of this spittle a being, to whom
they gave the name of Kvaser, and whom they endowed
with such a high degree of intelligence that no one
could ask him a question that he was unable to answer.
Kvaser then traversed the whole world to teach men
wisdom, but the dwarfs, Fjalar and Galar, having invited
him to a feast, treacherously murdered him. They let
his blood run into two cups and a kettle. The name
of the kettle is Odrœrer, and the names of the cups are
Son and Bodn. By mixing up his blood with honey
they composed a drink of such surpassing excellence
that whoever partakes of it acquires the gift of song
(becomes a poet or man of knowledge, <i>skáld</i>, <i>eða
fræðamaðr</i>). When the gods inquired what had become
of Kvaser, the dwarfs told them that he had been suffocated
with his own wisdom, not being able to find
anyone who, by proposing to him a sufficient number
of learned questions, might relieve him of its super-abundance.</p>

<p class='c004'>The dwarfs invited a giant, by name Gilling, and his
wife. They proposed to the giant to take a boat-ride
with them out on the sea, but they rowed on to a rock
and capsized. Gilling could not swim, and perished, but
the dwarfs rowed ashore, and told his wife of his death,
which made her burst forth in a flood of tears. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Fjalar asked her whether it would not be some consolation
to her to look out upon the water, where her
husband had perished; and when she consented to this,
Fjalar said to his brother Galar that he should get up
above the door, and, as she passed out through it, he
should let fall a mill-stone upon her head, for he was
sick and disgusted with her crying. The brother did
so, and thus she perished also. A son of Gilling, a
giant by name Suttung, avenged these treacherous deeds.
He took the dwarfs out to sea and placed them on a
shoal, which was flooded at high water. In this critical
position they implored Suttung to spare their lives, and
accept the verse-inspiring beverage, which they possessed,
as an atonement for their having killed his parents.
Suttung, having agreed to these conditions, released the
dwarfs, and, carrying the mead home with him, committed
it to the care of his daughter Gunlad. Hence
poetry is indifferently called Kvaser’s blood, Suttung’s
mead, the dwarfs’ ransom, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>How did the gods get possession of this valuable
mead of Suttung? Odin being fully determined to acquire
it, set out for Jotunheim, and after journeying
for some time he came to a meadow, in which nine
thralls were mowing. Entering into conversation with
them, Odin offered to whet their scythes, an offer which
they gladly accepted. He took a whetstone from his
belt and whetted their scythes, and finding that it had
given their scythes an extraordinarily keen edge the
thralls asked him whether he was willing to dispose of it;
but Odin threw the whetstone up into the air, and as all
the thralls attempted to catch it as it fell, each brought
his scythe to bear on the neck of one of his comrades,
so that they were all killed in the scramble. Odin took
up his night’s lodging at the house of Suttung’s brother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>Bauge, who told him he was sadly at a loss for laborers,
his nine thralls having slain each other. Odin who
here called himself Bolverk (one who can perform the
most difficult work), said that for a draught of Suttung’s
mead he would do the work of nine men for him. Bauge
answered that he had no control over it. Suttung wanted
it alone, but he would go with Bolverk and try to get
it. These terms were agreed on and Odin worked for
Bauge the whole summer, doing the work of nine men;
but when winter set in he wanted his reward. Bauge
and Odin set out together, and Bauge explained to
Suttung the agreement between him and Bolverk, but
Suttung was deaf to his brother’s entreaties and would
not part with a drop of the precious drink, which was
carefully preserved in a cavern under his daughter’s custody.
Into this cavern Odin was resolved to penetrate.
We must invent some stratagem, said he to Bauge. He
then gave Bauge the augur, which is called Rate, and
said to him that he should bore a hole through the rock,
if the edge of the augur was sharp enough. Bauge did
so, and said that he now had bored through. But Odin,
or Bolverk as he is here called, blew into the augur-hole
and the chips flew into his face. He then perceived
that Bauge intended to deceive him and commanded
him to bore clear through. Bauge bored again,
and, when Bolverk blew a second time, the chips flew
the other way. Then Odin transformed himself into a
worm, crept through the hole, and resuming his natural
shape won the heart of Gunlad. Bauge put the augur
down after him, but missed him. After having passed
three nights with the fair maiden, he had no great difficulty
in inducing her to let him take a draught out
of each of the three jars called Odrœrer, Bodn, and
Son, in which the mead was kept. But wishing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>make the most of his advantage, he drank so deep that
not a drop was left in the vessels. Transforming himself
into an eagle, he then flew off as fast as his wings could
carry him, but Suttung becoming aware of the stratagem,
also took upon himself an eagle’s guise and flew
after him. The gods, on seeing him approach Asgard,
set out in the yard all the jars they could lay their hands
on, which Odin filled by disgorging through his beak
the wonder-working liquor he had drunk. He was however
so near being caught by Suttung, that he sent some
of the mead after him backwards, and as no care was
taken of this it fell to the share of poetasters. It is
called the drink of silly poets. But the mead discharged
into the jars was kept for the gods and for those men
who have sufficient wit to make a right use of it. Hence
poetry is called Odin’s booty, Odin’s gift, the beverage
of the gods, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>But let us look at this myth in its older and purer
form. Thus the Elder Edda, in Hávamál:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oblivion’s heron ’t is called</div>
      <div class='line'>That over potations hovers;</div>
      <div class='line'>He steals the minds of men.</div>
      <div class='line'>With this bird’s pinions</div>
      <div class='line'>I was fettered</div>
      <div class='line'>In Gunlad’s dwelling.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Drunk I was,</div>
      <div class='line'>I was over-drunk</div>
      <div class='line'>At that cunning Fjalar’s.</div>
      <div class='line'>It’s the best drunkenness</div>
      <div class='line'>When every one after it</div>
      <div class='line'>Regains his reason.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This passage then refers to the effects of the strong
drink of poetry, and Odin recommends us to use it with
moderation. Would it not be well for some of our poets
to heed the advice?</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Thus Hávamál again:</p>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>That I could have come</div>

      <div class='line'>Had not Gunlad aided me</div>
      <div class='line'>That good damsel</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On the day following</div>
      <div class='line'>Came the frost-giants</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>To learn something of the High One.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the High One’s hall:</div>
      <div class='line'>After Bolverk they inquired</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether he with the gods were come,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or Suttung had destroyed him.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Odin, I believe,</div>
      <div class='line'>A ring-oath gave.</div>
      <div class='line'>Who in his faith will trust?</div>
      <div class='line'>Suttung defrauded,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his drink bereft,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Gunlad made to weep.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is a beautiful idea that Odin creeps into Suttung’s
hall as a serpent, but when he has drunk the mead of
poetry, when he has become inspired, he soars away on
eagles’ pinions.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin’s name, Bolverk, may mean the one working evil,
which might be said of him in relation to the giants,
or the one who accomplishes difficult things, which then
would impersonate the difficulty in mastering the art of
poetry. Without a severe struggle no one can gain a
victory in the art of poetry, and least of all in the Old
Norse language. Gunlad (from <i>gunnr</i>, struggle, and
<i>laða</i>, to invite) invites Odin to this struggle. She sits
well fortified in the abode of the giant. She is surrounded
by stone walls. The cup in which was the mead
is called Odrœrer (<i>od-rœrer</i>, that which moves the spirit);
that is, the cup of inspiration; and the myth is as clear
as these names. Kvaser is the fruit of which the juice
is pressed and mixed with honey; it produces the inspiring
drink. It is also pertinently said that Kvaser
perishes in his own wisdom. Does not the fruit burst
from its superabundance of juice? But do not take only
the outside skin of this myth; press the ethical juice
out of it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>It should be noticed here that Kvaser (the spit, the
ripe fruit) is produced by a union of asas and vans, an
intimate union of the solid and liquid elements.</p>

<p class='c004'>This myth also illustrates the wide difference between
the Elder and the Younger Edda. How much purer and
poetic in the former than in the latter! <i>Ex ipso fonte
dulcius bibuntur aquæ.</i> In the Elder Edda is water in
which it is worth our while to fish.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='14'>XIV</abbr>. SAGA.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Odin is not only the inventor of poetry, he also
favors and protects history, Saga. The Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sokvabek hight the fourth dwelling.,</div>

      <div class='line'>Glad drink there Odin and Saga</div>
      <div class='line'>Every day from golden cups.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The charming influence of history could not be more
beautifully described.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sokvabek is the brook of the deep. From the deep
arise the thoughts and roll as cool refreshing waves
through golden words. Saga can tell, Odin can think,
about it. Thus they sit together day after day and night
after night and refresh their minds from the fountain of
history. Saga is the second of the goddesses. She dwells
at Sokvabek, a very large and stately abode. The
stream of history is large, it is broad and deep. Saga is
from the word meaning <i>to say</i>. In Greece Klio was one
of the muses, but in Norseland Saga is alone, united
with Odin, the father of heroic deeds. Her favor is the
hope of the youth and the delight of the old man.</p>

  <h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='15'>XV</abbr>. ODIN AS THE INVENTOR OF RUNES.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The original meaning of the word rune is <i>secret</i>,
and it was used to signify a mysterious song, mysterious
doctrine, mysterious speech, and mysterious writing.
Our ancestors had an alphabet called runes, before they
learned the so-called Roman characters. The runic stave-row
was a futhore (<i>f</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>k</i>), not an alphabet
(<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>) as in Greek or Latin. But what does it mean
mythologically, that Odin is the inventor of the runes?
Odin himself says in his famous Rune-song in the Elder
Edda:</p>

<p class='c009'>Odin’s sister or wife is, as we have seen, Frigg, the
earth, and there is much between heaven and earth of
which the wisest men do not even dream, much that the
profoundest philosophy is unable to unravel, and this is
what Odin never teaches to maid or wife of man.</p>

<p class='c004'>The runes of Odin were risted on the shield which
stands before the shining god, on the ear of Aarvak (the
ever-wakeful), and on the hoof of Alsvin; on the wheels
that roll under Rogner’s chariot, on Sleipner’s reins, on
the paw of the bear and on the tongue of Brage; on the
claws of the wolf, on the beak of the eagle, on bloody
wings and on the end of the bridge (the rainbow); on
glass, on gold, on wine and on herb; on Vile’s heart, on
the point of Gungner (Odin’s spear), on Grane’s breast,
on the nails of the norn and on the beak of the owl.
All, that were carved, were afterwards scraped off, mixed
with the holy mead and sent out into all parts of the
world. Some are with the asas, some with the elves,
and some  with the sons of men.</p>

<p class='c004'>All this and even more that is omitted we find in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>Elder Edda. What are Odin’s runes? What but a new
expression of his being? Odin’s runes represent the
might and wisdom with which he rules all nature, even
its most secret phenomena. Odin, as master of runes, is
the spirit that subdues and controls physical nature. He
governs inanimate nature, the wind, the sea, the fire, and
the mind of man, the hate of the enemy and the love of
woman. Everything submits to his mighty sway, and
thus the runes were risted on all possible things in heaven
and on earth. He is the spirit of the world, that pervades
everything, the almighty creator of heaven and
earth, or, to use more mythological expression, the
father of gods and men.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin hung nine days on the tree (Ygdrasil) and sacrificed
himself to himself, and wounded himself with his
own spear. This has been interpreted to mean the nine
months in which the child is developed in its mother’s
womb. Turn back and read the first strophes carefully,
and it will be found that there is some sense in this interpretation;
but, kind reader, did you ever try to subdue
and penetrate into the secrets of matter with your mind?
Do you know that knowledge cannot be acquired without
labor, without struggle, without sacrifice, without
solemn consecration of one’s self to an idea? Do you
remember that Odin gave his eye in pawn for a drink
from Mimer’s fountain? The spear with which he now
wounds himself shows how solemnly he consecrates
himself. For the sake of this struggle to acquire knowledge,
the spirit offers itself to itself. It knows what hardships
and sufferings must be encountered on the road to
knowledge, but it bravely faces these obstacles, it wants
to wrestle with them; that is its greatness, its glory, its
power. Nine nights Odin hangs on the tree. Rome was
not built in a day. <i>Tantæ molis erat Romanas condere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>gentes!</i> Neither is knowledge acquired in a day. The
mind is developed by a slow process. He neither eats
nor drinks, he fasts. You must also curb your bodily
appetites, and, like Odin, look down into the depths and
penetrate the mysteries of nature with your mind. Then
will you learn all those wonderful songs that Odin
learned crying before he fell from the tree.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin is the author of the runic incantations that
played so conspicuous a part in the social and religious
life of the Norseman. The belief in sorcery (<i>galdr</i> and
<i>seiðr</i>) was universal among the heathen Norsemen, and
it had its origin in the mythology, which represents the
magic arts as an invention of Odin.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Odin was preëminently the god of war. He who
fell in battle came after death to Odin in Valhal. There
he began the battle anew, fell and arose again. Glorious
was the life in Valhal.</p>

<p class='c004'>The hall was called Valhal, that is, the hall of the
slain; Odin was called Valfather (father of the slain),
and the maids he sent out to choose the fallen heroes
on the field of battle were called valkyries. Valhal
must not, as before stated, be confused with the silver-roofed
valaskjalf.</p>

<p class='c004'>The heroes who came to Valhal were called einherjes,
from <i>ein</i> and <i>herja</i>, which together mean the excellent
warrior, and we find that Odin was also called Herja-father
(father of heroes).</p>

<p class='c004'>Valhal is situated in Gladsheim. It is large and
resplendent with gold; spears support its ceiling, it is
roofed with shields, and coats of mail adorn its benches.
Swords serve the purpose of fire, and of its immense size
we can form some idea when we read in the Elder Edda
that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Five hundred doors</div>
      <div class='line'>And forty more</div>

      <div class='line'>Eight hundred heroes through each door</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall issue forth</div>
      <div class='line'>Against the wolf to combat.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Outside of Valhal stands the shining grove Glaser.
All its leaves are red gold, whence gold is frequently
called Glaser’s leaves.</p>

<p class='c004'>What does Odin give all his guests to eat? If all
the men who have fallen in fight since the beginning of
the world are gone to Odin in Valhal, there must be a
great crowd there. Yes, the crowd there is indeed great,
but great though it be, it will still be thought too little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>when the wolf comes (the end of the world). But
however great the band of men in Valhal may be, the
flesh of the boar Sæhrimner will more than suffice for
their sustenance. This boar is cooked every morning,
but becomes whole again every night. The cook is called
Andhrimner and the kettle Eldhrimner. Thus the Elder
Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Andhrimner cooks</div>
      <div class='line'>In Eldhrimner</div>
      <div class='line'>Sæhrimner;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis the best of flesh;</div>
      <div class='line'>But few know</div>
      <div class='line'>What the einherjes eat.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What do the guests of Odin drink? Do you imagine
that Allfather would invite kings and jarls and other
great men and give them nothing but water to drink?
In that case many of those, who had endured the
greatest hardships and received deadly wounds in order
to obtain access to Valhal, would find that they had paid
too great a price for their water drink, and would indeed
have reason to complain were they there to meet with
no better entertainment. But we shall see that the case
is quite otherwise; for the she-goat Heidrun (the clear
stream) stands above Valhal and feeds on the leaves of
a very famous tree. This tree is called Lerad (affording
protection), and from the teats of the she-goat flows
mead in such great abundance that every day a bowl,
large enough to hold more than would suffice for all
the heroes, is filled with it. And still more wonderful
is what is told of the stag, Eikthyrner (the oak-thorned,
having knotty horns), which also stands over Valhal and
feeds upon the leaves of the same tree, and while he is
feeding so many drops fall from his antlers down into
Hvergelmer that they furnish sufficient water for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>thirty-six rivers that issuing thence flow twelve to the
abodes of the gods, twelve to the abodes of men, and
twelve to Niflheim.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ah! our ancestors were uncultivated barbarians, and
that is proved by the life in Valhal, where the heroes
ate pork and drank mead! But what are we, then, who
do the same thing? Let us look a little more carefully
at the words they used. Food they called flesh, and
drink, mead,—expressions taken from life; but they
connected an infinitely higher idea with the heavenly
nourishment. Although but few know what the einherjes
eat, we ought to know it. When we hear the
word ambrosia, we think of a very fine nourishment,
although we do not know what it was. In the <i>Iliad</i>
(14, 170), it is used of pure water. The words used in
the Norse mythology in reference to the food and drink
of the gods are very simple, And-hrimner, Eld-hrimner,
and Sæ-hrimner. Hrim (rime) is the first and most
delicate transition from a liquid to a solid; hrimner is
the one producing this transition. The food was formed,
as the words clearly show, by air (<i>and</i>, <i>önd</i>, <i>aande</i>,
breath), by fire (<i>eld</i>), and by water (<i>sæ</i>, sea). We have
here the most delicate formation of the most delicate
elements. There is nothing earthly in it. The fundamental
element is water boiled by the fire, which is
nourished by the air; and the drink is the clear stream,
which flows from the highest abodes of heaven, the pure
ethereal current, which comes from the distant regions
where the winds are silent. Nay, we cannot even call it
a drink, but it is the purest and most delicate breath of
the air, that fills the lungs of the immortal heroes in
Valhal.</p>

<p class='c004'>A mighty band of men there is in Valhal, and Odin
must indeed be a great chieftain to command such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>numerous host; but how do the heroes pass their time
when they are not drinking? Answer: Every day, as
soon as they have dressed themselves, they ride out into
the court, and there fight until they cut each other into
pieces. This is their pastime. But when meal-time approaches,
they remount their steeds and return to drink
mead from the skulls of their enemies<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a> in Valhal. Thus
the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

      <div class='line'>The einherjes all</div>

  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='17'>XVII</abbr>. THE VALKYRIES (VALKYRJUR).</h4>
<p class='c006'>As the god of war, Odin sends out his maids to choose
the fallen heroes (<i>kjósa val</i>). They are called valkyries
and valmaids (<i>valmeyar</i>). The valkyries serve in Valhal,
where they bear in the drink, take care of the drinking-horns,
and wait upon the table. Odin sends them to
every field of battle, to make choice of those who are to
be slain and to sway the victory. The youngest of the
norns, Skuld, also rides forth to choose the slain and
turn the combat. More than a dozen valkyries are
named in the Elder Edda, and all these have reference
to the activities of war.</p>

<p class='c004'>This myth about Odin as the god of war, about Valhal
and the valkyries, exercised a great influence upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the mind and character of our ancestors. The dying
hero knows that the valkyries have been sent after him
to invite him home to Odin’s hall, and he receives their
message with joy and gladness. That the brave were
to be taken after death to Valhal was one of the fundamental
points, if not the soul, of the Norse religion.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
The Norsemen felt in their hearts that it was absolutely
necessary to be brave. Odin would not care for them,
but despise and thrust them away from him, if they were
not brave. And is there not some truth in this doctrine?
Is it not still a preëminent duty to be brave? Is it not
the first duty of man to subdue fear? What can we
accomplish until we have got rid of fear? A man is
a slave, a coward, his very thoughts are false, until he
has got fear under his feet. Thus we find that the
Odinic doctrine, if we disentangle the real kernel and
essence of it, is true even in our times. A man must
be valiant—he must march forward and acquit himself
like a man. How much of a man he is will be determined
in most cases by the completeness of his victory
over fear. Their views of Odin, Valhal and the valkyries
made the Norsemen think it a shame and misery
not to die in battle; and if natural death seemed to be
coming on, they would cut wounds in their flesh,
that Odin might receive them as warriors slain. Old
kings, about to die, had their bodies laid in a ship;
the ship was sent forth with sails set, and a slow fire
burning it, so that once out at sea it might blaze up
in flame, and in such manner bury worthily the hero
both in the sky and in the ocean. The Norse viking
fought with an indomitable, rugged energy. He stood
in the prow of his ship, silent, with closed lips, defying
the wild ocean with its monsters, and all men and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>things. No Homer sang of these Norse warriors and
sea-kings, but their heroic deeds and wild deaths are
the ever-recurring theme of the skalds.</p>

<p class='c004'>The death of the Norse viking is beautifully described
in the following strophe from Professor Hjalmar
Hjorth Boyesen’s poem, entitled <i>Odin’s Ravens</i>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>In the prow with head uplifted</div>
      <div class='line'>Stood the chief like wrathful Thor;</div>
      <div class='line'>Through his locks the snow-flakes drifted</div>
      <div class='line'>Bleached their hue from gold to hoar.</div>
      <div class='line'>Mid the crash of mast and rafter</div>
      <div class='line'>Norsemen leaped through death with laughter</div>
      <div class='line'>Up through Valhal’s wide-flung door.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Regner Lodbrok thus ends his famous song, the
Krákumál:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Cease, my strain! I hear a voice</div>

      <div class='line'>I fall, but smiling shall I die.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

the valkyries Gondul and Skogul in the heat of battle:</p>

<p class='c009'>An interpretation of the valkyries is not necessary.

<p class='c004'>Ethically considered, then, Odin symbolizes the

and from which their daring exploits sprang; and we
know that this hope of victory did not leave the hero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>when he fell bleeding on the field of battle, but followed
him borne in valkyrian arms to Valhal, and thence he

  <h3 id='chap2-2' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. <br /> HERMOD, TYR, HEIMDAL, BRAGE, AND IDUN.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='1'>I</abbr>. HERMOD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Odin’s sons are emanations of his own being. As
the god of war, warlike valor is one of his servants,
and honor another. He invents the art of poetry, but the
execution of it he leaves to his son Brage. He does not
meddle with thunder, having left this work of a lower
order to his son Thor. He is the father of light and
darkness, and he leaves the beneficent light to diffuse
itself and struggle with darkness independently (Balder
and Hoder). Nor does he himself watch the rainbow,
but let the watchful Heimdal take care of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hermod (the valiant in combat) was the son of Odin
and messenger of the gods. Odin himself gave him
helmet and corselet, the means by which to display his
warlike character, and he is sent on all dangerous missions.
Of his many exploits the most important one is
when he was sent on Sleipner to Hel to bring Balder
back. It was Hermod and Brage who were sent to bid
Hakon, the king, welcome, when he arrived at Valhal.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. TYR.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Tyr’s name is preserved in Tuesday. He is the god
of martial honor (compare the German <i>Zier</i>). Tyr is
the most daring and intrepid of all the gods. It is he
who dispenses valor in war; hence warriors do well to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>invoke him. It has become proverbial to say of a man
who surpasses all others in valor, that he is Tyr-strong,
or valiant as Tyr. A man noted for his wisdom is also
said to be wise as Tyr. He gives a splendid proof of
his intrepidity when the gods try to persuade the wolf
Fenrer, as we shall see hereafter, to let himself be
bound up with the chain Gleipner. The wolf fearing
that the gods would never afterwards unloose him, consented
to be bound only on the condition that while
they were chaining him he should keep Tyr’s hand
between this jaws. Tyr did not hesitate to put his hand
in the monster’s mouth, but when the Fenriswolf perceived
that the gods had no intention to unchain him,
he bit the hand off at that point which has ever since
been called the wolf’s joint (<i>úlfliðr</i>), the wrist. From
that time Tyr has but one hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tyr is the son of Odin, and it is through him the
latter, as the god of war, awakens wild courage. Thus
he is the god of honor, and when the noble gods desire
to tame the raging flames he naturally has to arouse all
his courage and even sacrifice a part of himself, just as
we frequently have to sacrifice some of our comforts to
keep clear of rogues and scoundrels.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. HEIMDAL. (HEIMDALLR).</h4>
<p class='c006'>Heimdal is the son of Odin, and is called the white
god (<i>hvíti áss</i>, the pure, innocent god). He is the son
of nine virgins, who were sisters, and is a very sacred
and powerful deity. Thus he says in the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Born was I of mothers nine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Son I am of sisters nine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He also bears the appellation of the gold-toothed, for his
teeth were of pure gold, and the appellation Hallinskide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>(<i>hallinskiði</i>, the owner of the vaulted arch). His horse
is called Gulltop (<i>goldtop</i>), and he dwells in Himminbjorg,
the mountains of heaven, at the end of Bifrost, the rainbow.
He is the warder of the gods, and is therefore
placed on the borders of heaven to prevent the giants
from forcing their way over the bridge. He requires less
sleep than a bird and sees by night as well as by day a
hundred miles around him. So acute is his ear that no
sound escapes him, for he can even hear the grass growing
on the earth and the wool on a sheep’s back. He
has a horn called Gjallar-horn, which is heard throughout
the universe. Thus the Elder Edda, in the lay of
Grimner:</p>

<p class='c009'>Heimdal has a sword called Hofud (head); he figures
at the death of Balder and appears in Ragnarok. Physically
interpreted, Heimdal is the god of the rainbow,
but the brilliant rainbow most beautifully symbolizes
the favoring grace of the gods. The rainbow itself is
called <i>ásbrú</i> (asabridge) or Bifrost (the trembling way),
and he who has seen a perfect rainbow can appreciate
how this resplendent arch among all races has served
as a symbol of peace, the bridge between heaven and
earth, the bridge connecting the races of the earth with
the gods. Did not God in Genesis set his bow in the
cloud that it should be for a token of a covenant between
him and the earth? And when our poor laboring
masses get their taste cultivated for poetry, art, and
mythological lore,—when they have learned to appreciate

<p class='c009'>In Greece we find the goddess Iris as the impersonation
of the rainbow; while in the Bible the rainbow
is not personified, and in no mythological system does
the graceful divinity of the rainbow enter so prominently
into the affairs of men as does our Heimdal. In the first
verse of Völuspá, all mankind is called the sons of Heimdal,
and this thought is developed in a separate lay in
the Elder Edda, called Rigsmál, the lay of Rig (Heimdal),
to which the reader is referred.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='4'>IV</abbr>. BRAGE AND IDUN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Brage is the son of Odin, and Idun is Brage’s wife.
Brage is celebrated for his wisdom, but more especially
for his eloquence and correct forms of speech. He
is not only eminently skilled in poetry, but the art itself
is from his name called <i>Brage</i>, which epithet is also used
to denote a distinguished poet or poetess. Runes are
risted on his tongue. He wears a long flowing beard,
and persons with heavy beard are called after him, beard-brage
(<i>skeggbragi</i>). His wife Idun (<i>Iðunn</i>) keeps in a
box the apples which the gods, when they feel old age
approaching, have only to taste of to become young again.
It is in this manner they will be kept in renovated youth
until Ragnarok. This is a great treasure committed to
the guardianship and good faith of Idun, and it shall be
related how great a risk the gods once ran.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>At the feast after the death of a king or jarl, it was
customary among the Norsemen for the heir to occupy
a lower bench in front of the chief seat, until Brage’s
bowl was brought in. Then he arose, made a pledge,
and drank the cup of Brage. After that he was conducted
into the seat of his father.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the sacrificial feasts of the Norsemen, the conductor
of the sacrifice consecrated the drinking-horns as
well as the sacrificed food. The guests first drank Odin’s
horn, for the victory and rule of the king; next they
drank Njord’s and Frey’s horns, for prosperous seasons
and for peace; and then many were accustomed to drink
a horn to Brage, the god of poetry. A characteristic
ceremony in connection with this horn was, that when
the bowl was raised, the promise of performing some
great deed was made, which might furnish material for
the songs of the skalds. This makes the character of
Brage perfectly clear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Idun’s name is derived from the root <i>ið</i>, and expresses
a constant activity and renovation, which idea
becomes more firmly established by the following myth.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='5'>V</abbr>. IDUN AND HER APPLES.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Æger, the god of the sea, who was well skilled in
magic, went to Asgard, where the gods gave him a
very good reception. Supper-time having come, the
twelve mighty gods, together with the goddesses Frigg,
Freyja, Gefjun, Idun, Gerd, Sigun, Fulla, and Nanna,
seated themselves on their lofty doom seats, in a hall
around which were arranged swords of such surpassing
brilliancy that no other light was necessary. While they
were emptying their capacious drinking-horns, Æger,
who sat next to Brage, requested him to relate something
concerning the asas. Brage instantly complied with his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>request by informing him of what had happened to
Idun.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once, he said, when Odin, Loke and Hœner went
on a journey, they came to a valley where a herd of
oxen were grazing, and, being sadly in want of provisions,
did not scruple to kill one for their supper.
Vain, however, were their efforts to boil the flesh;
they found it, every time they took the lid off the kettle,
as raw as when first put in. While they were endeavoring
to account for this singular circumstance a noise
was heard above them, and on looking up they beheld
an enormous eagle perched on the branch of an oak
tree. If you are willing to let me have my share of the
flesh, said the eagle, it shall soon be boiled. And on
assenting to this proposal it flew down and snatched up
a leg and two shoulders of the ox—a proceeding which
so incensed Loke that he picked up a large pole and
made it fall pretty heavily on the eagle’s back. It was,
however, not an eagle that Loke struck, but the renowned
giant Thjasse, clad in his eagle-plumage. Loke soon
found this out to his sorrow, for while one end of the
pole stuck fast to the eagle’s back, he was unable to let
go his hold of the other end, and was consequently trailed
by the eagle-clad giant over rocks and forests until he was
almost torn to pieces, and he thought his arms would
be pulled off at the shoulders. Loke in this predicament
began to sue for peace, but Thjasse told him that
he should never be released from his hold until he
bound himself by a solemn oath to bring Idun and her
apples out of Asgard. Loke very willingly gave his
oath to bring about this, and went back in a piteous
plight to his companions.</p>

<p class='c004'>On his return to Asgard, Loke told Idun that in a
forest not very far from the celestial residence he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>found apples growing, which he thought were of a much
better quality than her own, and that at all events it
was worth while to make a comparison between them.
Idun, deceived by his words, took her apples and went
with him into the forest, but they had no sooner entered
it than Thjasse, clad in his eagle-plumage, flew rapidly
toward them, and, catching up Idun, carried her and
her treasure off with him to Jotunheim. The gods
being thus deprived of their renovating apples, soon
became wrinkled and gray, old age was creeping fast
upon them when they discovered that Loke had been,
as usual, the contriver of all the mischief that had
befallen them. Inquiry was made about Idun in the
assembly which was called, and the last anybody knew
about her was that she had been seen going out of
Asgard in company with Loke. They therefore threatened
him with torture and death if he did not instantly
hit upon some expedient for bringing back Idun and
her apples to Asgard. This threat terrified Loke, and
he promised to bring her back from Jotunheim if
Freyja would lend him her falcon-plumage. He got the
falcon-plumage of Freyja, flew in it to Jotunheim, and
finding that Thjasse was out at sea fishing, he lost no
time in transforming Idun into a nut and flying off
with her in his claws. But when Thjasse returned and
became aware of what had happened, he put on his
eagle-plumage and flew after them. When the gods saw
Loke approach, holding Idun changed into a nut between
his claws, and Thjasse with his outspread eagle-wings
ready to overtake him, they placed on the walls of Asgard
bundles of chips, which they set fire to the instant Loke
had flown over them; and as Thjasse could not stop
his flight, the fire caught his plumage, and he thus fell
into the power of the gods, who slew him within the
portals of the celestial residence.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>When these tidings came to Thjasse’s daughter, Skade
(<i>Skaði</i>, German <i>Schade</i>, harm), she put on her armor and
went to Asgard, fully determined to avenge her father’s
death; but the gods having declared their willingness to
atone for the deed, an amicable arrangement was entered
into. Skade was to choose a husband in Asgard, and
the gods were to make her laugh, a feat which she flattered
herself it would be impossible for any one to accomplish.
Her choice of a husband was to be determined
by a mere inspection of the feet of the gods, it being
stipulated that the feet should be the only part of their
persons visible until she had made known her determination.
In inspecting the row of feet placed before her,
Skade took a fancy to a pair which from their fine proportions
she thought certainly must be those of Balder.
I choose these, she said, for on Balder there is nothing
unseemly. The feet were however Njord’s, and Njord
was given her for a husband; and as Loke managed to
make her laugh by playing some diverting antics with
a goat, the atonement was fully effected. It is even said
that Odin did more than had been stipulated, by taking
out Thjasse’s eyes and placing them to shine as stars in
the firmament.</p>

<p class='c004'>This myth, interpreted by the visible workings of
nature, means that Idun (the ever-renovating spring)
being in the possession of Thjasse (the desolating winter),
all the gods—that is, all nature—languishes until
she is delivered from her captivity. On this being
effected, her presence again diffuses joy and gladness,
and all things revive; while her pursuer, winter, with
his icy breath, dissolves in the solar rays indicated by
the fires lighted on the walls of Asgard. The wintry
blasts rage so fearfully in the flames, that the flesh cannot
be boiled, and the wind even carries a burning (Loke)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>stick with it. The ethical interpretation will suggest
itself to every reader, and Idun is to Brage, who sings
among the trees and by the musical brooks of spring,
what a poetical contemplation of the busy forces of
nature in producing blossoms and ripening fruit must
always be to every son of Brage.</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='1'>I</abbr>. BALDER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Balder is the favorite of all nature, of all the gods
and of men. He is son of Odin and Frigg, and
it may be truly said of him that he is the best god, and
that all mankind are loud in his praise. So fair and
dazzling is he in form and features, that rays of light
seem to issue from him; and we may form some idea
of the beauty of his hair when we know that the <i>whitest
of all plants</i> is called <i>Balder’s brow</i>.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Balder is the
mildest, the wisest and the most eloquent of all the gods,
yet such is his nature that the judgment he has pronounced
can never be altered. He dwells in the heavenly
mansion called Breidablik (the broad-shining splendor),
into which nothing unclean can enter. Thus the Elder
Edda, in the lay of Grimner:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Breidablik is the seventh,</div>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. THE DEATH OF BALDER THE GOOD.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>This was an event which the asas deemed of great
importance. Balder the Good having been tormented by
terrible dreams, indicating that his life was in great peril,
communicated them to the assembled gods, who, sorrow-stricken,
resolved to conjure all things to avert from him
the threatened danger. Then Frigg exacted an oath
from fire and water, from iron and all other metals, as
well as from stones, earths, diseases, beasts, birds, poisons,
and creeping things, that none of them would do any
harm to Balder. Still Odin feared that the prosperity of
the gods had vanished. He saddled his Sleipner and
rode down to Niflheim, where the dog from Hel met
him; it was bloody on the breast and barked a long time
at Odin. Odin advanced; the earth trembled beneath
him, and he came to the high dwelling of Hel. East of
the door he knew the grave of the vala was situated;
thither he rode and sang magic songs (<i>kvað galdra</i>),
until she unwillingly stood up and asked who disturbed
her peace, after she had been lying so long covered with
snow and wet with dew. Odin called himself Vegtam, a
son of Valtam, and asked for whom the benches were
strewn with rings and the couches were swimming in gold.
She replied that the mead was brewed for Balder, but all
the gods would despair. When Odin asked further who
should be Balder’s bane, she answered that Hoder would
hurl the famous branch and become the bane of Odin’s
son; but Rind should give birth to a son who, only one
night old, should wield a sword, and would neither wash
his hands nor comb his hair before he had avenged his
brother. But recognizing Odin by an enigmatical question,
she said: You are not Vegtam, as I believed, but
you are Odin, the old ruler. Odin replied: You are no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>vala, but the mother of three giants. Then the vala
told Odin to ride home and boast of his journey, but
assured him that no one should again visit her thus before
Loke should be loosed from his chains and the ruin
of the gods had come. Thus the lay of Vegtam in the
Elder Edda:</p>

<p class='c009'>When it had been made known that nothing in the
world would harm Balder, it became a favorite pastime
of the gods, at their meetings, to get Balder to stand up
and serve them as a mark, some hurling darts at him,
some stones, while others hewed at him with their swords
and battle-axes; for whatever they did none of them
could harm him, and this was regarded by all as a great
honor shown to Balder. But when Loke Laufeyarson
beheld the scene he was sorely vexed that Balder was
not hurt. Assuming, therefore, the guise of a woman
he went to Fensal, the mansion of Frigg. That goddess,
seeing the pretended woman, inquired of her whether
she knew what the gods were doing at their meetings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>The woman (Loke) replied that they were throwing
darts and stones at Balder, without being able to hurt
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ay, said Frigg, neither metal nor wood can hurt
Balder, for I have exacted an oath from all of them.</p>

<p class='c004'>What! exclaimed the woman, have all things sworn
to spare Balder?</p>

<p class='c004'>All things, replied Frigg, except one little shrub that
grows on the eastern side of Valhal, and is called mistletoe,
and which I thought too young and feeble to crave
an oath from.</p>

<p class='c004'>As soon as Loke heard this he went away, and,
resuming his natural form, pulled up the mistletoe and
repaired to the place where the gods were assembled.
There he found Hoder standing far to one side without
engaging in the sport, on account of his blindness.
Loke going up to him said: Why do not you also throw
something at Balder?</p>

<p class='c004'>Because I am blind, answered Hoder, and cannot see
where Balder is, and besides I have nothing to throw
with.</p>

<p class='c004'>Come then, said Loke, do like the rest, and show
honor to Balder by throwing this twig at him, and I will
direct your arm toward the place where he stands.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hoder then took the mistletoe, and under the guidance
of Loke darted it at Balder, who, pierced through
and through, fell down lifeless. Surely never was there
witnessed, either among gods or men, a more atrocious
deed than this! When Balder fell the gods were struck
speechless with horror, and then they looked at each
other; and all were of one mind to lay hands on him
who had done the deed, but they were obliged to delay
their vengeance out of respect for the sacred place (place
of peace) where they were assembled. They at length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>gave vent to their grief by such loud lamentations that
they were not able to express their grief to one another.
Odin, however, felt this misfortune most severely, because
he knew best how great was the mischief and the loss
which the gods had sustained by the death of Balder.
When the gods were a little composed, Frigg asked who
among them wished to gain all her love and favor by
riding to the lower world to try and find Balder, and
offer a ransom to Hel if she will permit Balder to return
to Asgard; whereupon Hermod, surnamed the Nimble,
offered to undertake the journey. Odin’s horse, Sleipner,
was then led forth and prepared for the journey; Hermod
mounted him and galloped hastily away.</p>

<p class='c004'>The god then took the dead body of Balder and
carried it to the sea, where lay Balder’s ship, Ringhorn,
which was the largest of all ships. But when they
wanted to launch this ship, in order to make Balder’s
funeral pile on it, they were unable to move it from the
place. In this predicament they sent a messenger to
Jotunheim for a certain giantess named Hyrroken (the
smoking fire), who came riding on a wolf and had
twisted serpents for her reins. As soon as she alighted
Odin ordered four berserks to hold her steed, but they
were obliged to throw the animal down on the ground
before they could manage it. Hyrroken then went to
the prow of the ship, and with a single push set it
afloat; but the motion was so violent that fire sparkled
from the underlaid rollers and the whole earth shook.
Thor, enraged at the sight, grasped his mallet and would
have broken the woman’s skull, had not the gods interceded
for her. Balder’s body was then carried to the
funeral pile on board the ship, and this ceremony had
such an effect upon Balder’s wife, Nanna, daughter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Nep, that her heart broke with grief, and her body was
laid upon the same pile and burned with that of her
husband. Thor stood beside the pile and consecrated it
with his hammer Mjolner. Before his feet sprang up a
dwarf called Lit. Thor kicked him with his foot into
the fire, so that he also was burned. There was a vast
concourse of various kinds of people at Balder’s funeral
procession. First of all came Odin, accompanied by
Frigg, the valkyries, and his ravens. Then came Frey
in his chariot, drawn by the boar Gullinburste (gold-brush),
or Slidrugtanne (the sharp-toothed). Heimdal
rode his horse Goldtop, and Freyja drove in her chariot
drawn by cats. There were also a great number of
frost-giants and mountain-giants present. Odin cast
upon the funeral pile the famous ring Draupner, which
had been made for him by the dwarfs, and possessed the
property of producing every ninth night eight rings of
equal weight. Balder’s horse, fully caparisoned, was
also laid upon the pile, and consumed in the same flames
with the body of his master.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile Hermod was proceeding on his mission.
Of him it is to be related that he rode nine days and as
many nights through dark and deep valleys, so dark
that he could not discern anything, until he came to the
river Gjol and passed over the Gjallar bridge (bridge
over the river Gjol), which is covered with glittering
gold. Modgud, the maiden who kept the bridge, asked
him his name and parentage, and added that the day
before five fylkes (kingdoms, bands) of dead men had
ridden over the bridge; but, she said, it did not shake
as much beneath all of them together as it does under
you alone, and you have not the complexion of the dead;
why then do you ride here on your way to Hel? I ride
to Hel, answered Hermod, to seek for Balder; have you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>perchance seen him pass this way? She replied that
Balder had ridden over the Gjallar bridge, and that the
road to the abodes of death (to Hel) lay downward and
toward the north.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hermod then continued his journey until he came
to the barred gates of Hel. Then he alighted from his
horse, drew the girths tighter, remounted him and
clapped both spurs into him. The horse cleared the gate
with a tremendous leap without touching it. Hermod
then rode forward to the palace, alighted and went in,
where he found his brother Balder occupying the most
distinguished seat in the hall, and spent the night in his
company. The next morning he entreated Hel (death)
to let Balder ride home with him, representing to her
the sorrow which prevailed among the gods. Hel replied
that it should now be tried whether Balder was so
universally beloved as he was said to be; if therefore,
she added, all things in the world, the living as well as
the lifeless, will weep for him, then he shall return to
the gods, but if anything speak against him or refuse
to weep, then Hel will keep him.</p>

<p class='c004'>After this Hermod rose up. Balder went with him
out of the hall and gave him the ring Draupner, to
present as a keepsake to Odin. Nanna sent Frigg a
carpet together with several other gifts, and to Fulla
she sent a gold finger-ring. Hermod then rode back to
Asgard and related everything that he had heard and
witnessed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gods upon this dispatched messengers throughout
all the world to beseech everything to weep, in
order that Balder might be delivered from the power of
Hel. All things very willingly complied with the request,—men,
animals, the earth, stones, trees, and all
metals, just as we see things weep when they come out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>of the frost into the warm air. When the messengers
were returning, with the conviction that their mission
had been quite successful, they found on their way
home a giantess (ogress, Icel. <i>gýgr</i>), who called herself
Thok. They bade her also weep Balder out of the dominion
of Hel. But she answered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thok will weep</div>
      <div class='line'>With dry tears<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>For Balder’s death;</div>
      <div class='line'>Neither in life nor in death</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave he me gladness.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let Hel keep what she has.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It is supposed that this giantess (<i>gýgr</i>) was no other
than Loke Laufeyarson himself, who had caused the gods
so many other troubles. Thus the Elder Edda refers to
the death of Balder in Völuspá:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I saw the concealed</div>
      <div class='line'>Fate of Balder,</div>
      <div class='line'>The blood-stained god,</div>
      <div class='line'>The son of Odin.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the fields</div>
      <div class='line'>There stood grown up,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slender and passing fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>The mistletoe.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From that shrub was made,</div>
      <div class='line'>As to me it seemed,</div>
      <div class='line'>A deadly noxious dart;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hoder shot it forth;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Frigg bewailed</div>
      <div class='line'>In Fensal</div>
      <div class='line'>Valhal’s calamity.</div>
      <div class='line'>Understand ye yet, or what?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To conquer Vafthrudner, and to reveal himself, Odin asks
him to solve this last problem:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>What said Odin</div>
      <div class='line'>In his son’s ear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere he on the pile was laid?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This is the question that Vafthrudner was unable to
answer, and hence he had to forfeit his head. <abbr class='spell'>N. M.</abbr>
Petersen thinks that Odin whispered into Balder’s ear
the name of the supreme god.</p>

<p class='c004'>This myth about the death of Balder finds an apt
explanation in the seasons of the year, in the change
from light to darkness, in Norseland. Balder represents
the bright and clear summer, when twilight and daybreak
kiss each other and go hand in hand in these
northern latitudes. His death by Hoder is the victory
of darkness over light, the darkness of winter over the
light of summer, and the revenge by Vale is the breaking
forth of new light after the wintry darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this connection it is also worthy of notice that
there used to be a custom, which is now nearly forgotten,
of celebrating the banishment of death or darkness, the
strife between winter and summer, together with the arrival
of the May-king and election of the May-queen.
Forgotten! yes, well may we ask how it could come to
pass that we through long centuries have worried and
tortured ourselves with every scrap of Greek and Latin
we could find, without caring the least for our own
beautiful and profound memories of the past. Death
was carried out in the image of a tree and thrown in
the water or burned. In the spring two men represent
summer and winter, the one clad in wintergreen or
leaves, the other in straw. They have a large company
of attendants with them, armed with staves, and they
fight with each other until winter (or death) is subdued.
They prick his eyes out or throw him into the water.
These customs, which prevailed throughout the middle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>ages, had their root and origin in the ancient myth
given above.</p>

<p class='c004'>No myth can be clearer than this one of Balder.
The Younger Edda says distinctly that he is so fair
and dazzling in form and features that rays of light
seem to issue from him. Balder, then, is the god of
light, the light of the world. Light is the best thing
we have in the world; it is white and pure; it cannot
be wounded; no shock can disturb it; nothing in
the world can kill it excepting its own negative, darkness
(Hoder). Loke (fire) is jealous of it; the pure
light of heaven and the blaze of fire are each other’s
eternal enemies. Balder does not fight, the mythology
gives no exploits by him; he only shines and dazzles,
conferring blessings upon all, and this he continues to
do steadfast and unchangeable, until darkness steals
upon him, darkness that does not itself know what
harm it is doing; and when Balder is dead, cries of
lamentation are heard throughout all nature. All nature
seeks light. Does not the eye of the child seek
the light of the morning, and does not the child weep
when light vanishes, when night sets in? Does not
this myth of Balder repeat itself in the old man, who
like Gœthe, when death darkened his eyes, cried out:
<i>mehr licht</i> (more light)? Does not the eagle from the
loftiest pinnacle of the mountain seek light? The
lark soars on his lofty pinions and greets in warbling
notes the king of day welcome back into his kingdom.
The tree firmly rooted in the ground strains toward the
light, spreading upward in search of it. The bird of
passage on his free wing flies after and follows the light.
Is it not the longing after light that draws the bird
southward in the fall when the days shorten in the
north, and draws the little wanderer back again as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>soon as the long northern days set in with all their
luminous and long-drawn hours? As Runeberg epigrammatically
has it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The bird of passage is of noble birth;</div>
      <div class='line'>He bears a motto, and his motto is,</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Lux mea dux</i>, Light is my leader.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Nay all living things, even the shells in the sea,
every leaf of the oak and every blade of grass seeks
light, and the blind poet sings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hail, holy light! offspring of heaven first born!</div>
      <div class='line'>He that hath light within his own clear breast</div>
      <div class='line'>May sit in the center and enjoy bright day;</div>
      <div class='line'>But he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts</div>
      <div class='line'>Benighted walks under the midday sun.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And another bard:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Light down from heaven descends,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ether pure in flowing bowls;</div>
      <div class='line'>Light up to heaven ascends,</div>
      <div class='line'>A mediator for our souls.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Ay, it would be resting satisfied with the shell to interpret
Balder as the mere impersonation of the natural
light of heaven. He represents and symbolizes in the
profoundest sense the heavenly light of the soul and of
the mind, purity, innocence, piety. There can be no
doubt that our ancestors combined the ethical with the
physical in this myth. All light comes from heaven.
The natural light shines into and illuminates the eye,
the spiritual shines into and illuminates the heart.
Innocence cannot be wounded. Arrogance and jealousy
throw their pointed arrows of slander at it, but they fall
harmless to the ground. But there is one inclination,
one unguarded spot among our other strong guarded
passions. The mischief-maker knows how to find this
and innocence is pierced. When Balder dies, a dark veil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>enshrouds all nature, and thus history clothes herself in
mourning, not because the hero dies, but because the
innocent Lincoln is pierced by the bullet of the foul
assassin, who turns to the night and flees. Every time
light is slain by darkness it is the beautiful and good
that is stricken down, but it is never stricken down
except to return and shine with increased splendor.
Balder dies in nature when the woods are stripped of
their foliage, when the flowers fade and the storms of
winter howl. Balder dies in the spiritual world when
the good are led away from the paths of virtue, when the
soul becomes dark and gloomy, forgetting its heavenly
origin. Balder returns in nature when the gentle winds
of spring stir the air, when the nightingale’s high note
is heard in the heavens, and the flowers are unlocked to
paint the laughing soil, when light takes the place of
gloom and darkness; Balder returns in the spiritual
world when the lost soul finds itself again, throws off
the mantle of darkness, and like a shining spirit soars
on wings of light to heaven, to God, who gave it.</p>

<p class='c004'>The flower which is sacred to Balder, the Balder’s
brow, is the <i>anthemis cotula</i>. It is a complete flower
with a yellow disc and white rays, a symbol of the sun
with its beaming light, a sunflower. What a poetical
thought! The light pouring down upon the earth from
beneath Balder’s eye-brows, and the hairs of his eye-lids
are the beams. What a theme for a Correggio, who
succeeded so well in painting the innocence of woman
beaming from her half-closed eyes!</p>

<p class='c004'>Balder’s wife is Nanna. She dies broken-hearted at
his death. She is the floral goddess who always turns
her smiling face toward the sun. Her father was Nep
(<i>nepr</i>, a bud), son of Odin. Nanna’s and Balder’s sending
the ring Draupner to Odin, a carpet to Frigg, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>a ring to Fulla, has been explained heretofore, and how
beautifully it symbolizes the return of earth’s flowery
carpet, with fruitfulness and abundance, will be evident
to every thoughtful reader.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sorrow of all nature we easily understand when
we know that Loke represents fire and Balder is gone to
Hel. All things weep, become damp, when brought from
the cold to the warm air, excepting fire, and we remember
that Thok, that is, Loke in disguise, wept dry tears
(sparks); but all genuine tears are caused by a change
of the heart from coldness to warmth. It is a common
expression in Iceland yet to say that the stones, when
covered with dew, weep for Balder (<i>gráta Baldr</i>). Balder’s
ship, Ringhorn, is rightly called the largest of all
ships. Ringhorn is the whole world, and the whole earth
is Balder’s funeral pile. The tops of the mountains are
the masts of this ship, which is round (ring) as the
whirling world.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is time we ceased talking about our barbarous
ancestors, for, if we rightly comprehend this myth of
Balder, we know that they appreciated, nay, profoundly
and poetically appreciated, the light that fills the eye
and blesses the heart, and were sensitive to the pain that
cuts through the bosom of man even into its finest and
most delicate fibers. In this myth of Balder is interwoven
the most delicate feelings with the sublimest
sentiments. Read it and comprehend it. Let the ear
and heart and soul be open to the voiceless music that
breathes through it. And when you have thus read
this myth, in connection with the other myths and in
connection with the best Sagas, then do not say another
word about the North not having any literature! Thanks
be to the norns, that the monks and priests, whose most
zealous work it was to root out the memories of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>past and reduce the gods of our fathers to commonplace
demons, did not succeed in their devastating mission
in faithful Iceland! Thanks be to Shakespeare, that
he did not forget the stern, majestic, impartial and
beautiful norns, even though he did change them into
the wrinkled witches that figure in Macbeth! Nay, that
this our ancient mythology, in spite of the wintry blasts
that have swept over it, in spite of the piercing cold
to which it has been exposed at the hand of those who
thought they came with healing for the nations, in
spite of all the persecution it has suffered from monks
and bishops, professors and kings; that it, in spite of all
these, has been able to bud and blossom in our Teutonic
folk-lore, our May-queens, and popular life, is proof of
the strong vital force it contained, and proof, too, of the
vigorous thought of our forefathers who preserved it.
And nowhere is this more evident than in Norway.
These stories which have their root in the Norse mythology
have been handed down by word of month from
generation to generation with remarkable fidelity. Look
at those long and narrow and deep valleys of Norway!
Those great clefts are deep furrows plowed in the mountain
mass in order that it might yield a bountiful crop
of folk-lore, the seed of which is the Edda mythology.
Let us give our children a share in the harvest!</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. FORSETE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Forsete is the son of Balder and Nanna. He possesses
the heavenly mansion called Glitner, and all disputants
at law who bring their cases before him go away perfectly
reconciled. His tribunal is the best that is to be found
among gods and men. Thus the Elder Edda, in the
lay of Grimner:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Glitner is the tenth mansion;</div>

<p class='c009'>Forsete means simply <i>president</i>. The island Helgoland
was formerly called Forseteland. Justice was
dealt out in Norseland during the bright season of the
year, and only while the sun was up, in the open air,
in the flowering lap of nature. The sanctity of the
assembly and purity of justice is expressed by the
golden columns and the silver roof of Glitner. The
splendor of Balder shone upon his son.</p>

<p class='c006'>THOR (<i>þórr</i>, <i>þunarr</i>, Anglo-Saxon <i>þunor</i>, German
<i>donner</i>, thunder), after whom Thursday is named
(Thor’s-day), is the chief god next after Odin. He is
a spring god, subduing the frost-giants.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thor wears a red beard, his nature is fire, he is
girded with the belt of strength, swings a hammer in
his hand, rides in a chariot drawn by two goats, from
whose hoofs and teeth sparks of fire flash, and the
scarlet cloud reflects his fiery eyes, over his head he
wears a crown of stars, under his feet rests the earth,
and it shows the footprints of his mighty steps. He
is called Asathor and also Akethor (from <i>aka</i>, to ride),
and is the strongest of gods and men. He is enormously
strong and terrible when angry, but, as is so
frequently the case with very strong men, his great
strength is coupled with a thoroughly inoffensive good-nature.
His realm is named Thrudvang and his mansion
Bilskirner, in which are five hundred and forty
halls. It is the largest house ever built. Thus the

<p class='c009'>Thor’s chariot is drawn by two goats, called Tanngnjost
and Tanngrisner. It is from his driving about in
this chariot he is called Akethor (charioteer-Thor). He
possesses three very precious articles. The first is a
mallet called Mjolner, which both the frost and mountain
giants know to their cost, when they see it hurled
against them in the air; and no wonder, for it has split
many a skull of their fathers and kindred. The second
rare thing he possesses is called the belt of strength or
prowess (Megingjarder). When he girds it about him
his divine strength is redoubled. The third precious
article which he possesses is his iron gauntlet, which he
is obliged to put on whenever he lays hold on the handle
of his mallet. No one is so wise as to be able to
relate all Thor’s marvelous exploits.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thor is the father of Magne, whose mother is Jarnsaxa,
and of Mode. He is the husband of Sif and step-father
of Uller; he is the protector of Asgard and Midgard,
and is frequently called Midgardsveor; his servants
are Thjalfe, and the sister of the latter, Roskva. Among
Thor’s several names the most common ones are Vingthor,
Vingner, and Hlorride. All this of course has reference
to him as the god of thunder. Thor, as has
been observed, is þunarr, thunder. Thrudvang, his realm,
is the heavy compact cloud, where he reigns; his mansion,
Bilskirner (<i>bil-skirnir</i>), are the flushes of lightning
that for a moment (<i>bil</i><a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a>) light up the heavens;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>his goats, Tanngnjost (teeth-gnasher) and Tanngrisner
(fire-flashing teeth), symbolize the flashes of lightning,
and so does also his red beard. Mjolner, his hammer,
is the crusher (compare the English word <i>mill</i><a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a>); his
belt, Megingjarder, is the girdle of strength; his sons,
Magne and Mode, symbolize strength and courage.
Vingthor is the flying thunderstorm and Hlorride is he
who rides in the flaming chariot. His servant Thjalfe
is the busy one, and Roskva is the rapid or nimble one.
That Thor is the god of thunder is also most clearly
shown in the Younger Edda, where it is related that
Thor goes on foot and is obliged every day to wade the
rivers Kormt and Ormt, and two others called Kerlaung,
when he goes to sit in judgment with the other gods at
the Urdar-fount, and cannot ride, as do the other gods.
If he did not walk as he goes to the doomstead under
the ash Ygdrasil, the Asabridge would be in flames
and the holy waters would become boiling hot, that is,
if Thor should drive over Bifrost in his thunder-chariot.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thor’s wife, Sif, is another symbol of the earth.
She is called the fair-haired. Gold is called Sif’s hair
on account of the myth already related, according to
which Loke cuts off her hair and gets dwarfs to forge
for her golden locks. The interpreters of mythology
are not willing to give to Sif the field waving with
ripe grain, which belongs to the god Frey, being symbolized
by his boar Goldenbristle, but say that Sif is
the mountain clad with grass, in contradistinction to
Jarnsaxa, who reigns in the barren deserts. Hrungner,
that is, the naked rock, tried to win the favor of Sif,
but did not succeed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Uller is the son of Sif and the step-son of Thor.
He is so well skilled in the use of the bow, and can go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>so fast on his snow-skates (<i>skees</i>), that in these arts no
one can contend with him. He is also very handsome
in his person and possesses every quality of a warrior;
wherefore it is proper to invoke him in single combats.
Uller’s mansion is Ydaler (valleys of rain). From his
running on skees we judge that he is a personification
of winter, and if the artist chooses him for his theme,
he must represent him standing on snow-shoes, clad in
winter-suit, with bow and arrow in his hands. We
are now prepared to give some of Thor’s adventures.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. THOR AND HRUNGNER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Thor had once gone eastward to crush trolls, but
Odin rode on his horse, Sleipner, to Jotunheim, and
came to a giant by name Hrungner. Then asked
Hrungner what man that was, who with a helmet of
gold rode through the air and over the sea, and added
that it was an extraordinarily good horse he had. Odin
replied that he would wager his head that so good a
horse could not be found in Jotunheim. Hrungner
said that it was indeed a very excellent horse, but he
had one, by name Goldfax (gold-mane), that could take
much longer paces, and he immediately sprang upon
his horse and galloped away after Odin. Odin constantly
kept ahead, but Hrungner’s giant nature had
become so excited that before he was himself aware of
it he had come within the gates of Asgard. When he
came to the door of the hall the gods invited him to
drink, which as soon as he had entered he demanded.
Then the gods set before him the bowls out of which
Thor was accustomed to drink, and them he emptied
each in one draught. And when he had become drunk,
he gave the freest vent to his loud boastings. He was
going to take Valhal, he said, and carry it off to Jotunheim;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>he would demolish Asgard and kill the gods,
except Freyja and Sif, whom he would take home with
him; and while Freyja was pouring the celestial beverage
into the bowls for him he remarked that he was
going to drink up all the ale of the gods. When the
gods at length grew tired of his arrogance, they named
Thor, who immediately came and swung his hammer
and was very much enraged, and asked who was to
blame that dogwise giants should be permitted to drink
there, or who had given safety to Hrungner in Valhal,
and why Freyja should pour ale for him as she did at
the feasts of the gods. Hrungner, looking at Thor with
anything but a friendly eye, answered that Odin had
invited him and that he was under his protection.
Thor said that Hrungner should come to rue that
invitation before he came out; but the giant answered
that it would be but little honor to Asathor to kill
him, unarmed as he was; it would be a better proof
of his valor if he dared contend with him at the
boundaries of his territory, at Grjottungard (<i>Grjóttunagarðar</i>).
Foolish was it also of me, continued
Hrungner, to leave my shield and my flint-stone at
home; had I my weapons here we would now try a
holmgang;<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a> but I declare you to be a coward if you
kill me unarmed. Thor would not excuse himself from
a duel when he was challenged out on a holm; this
was something that no one had ever offered him before.
Hrungner now went his way and hastened home.
This journey of Hrungner was much talked of by the
giants, and especially did his challenge of Thor awaken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>their interest, and it was of great importance to them
which of the two should come out from the combat
victorious. For if Hrungner, who was the most powerful
among the giants, should be conquered, they
might look for nothing but evil from Thor. They
therefore made at Grjottungard a man of clay, nine
rasts (miles?) high and three rasts broad between the
shoulders; they could not find a heart corresponding
to his size, and therefore took one out of a mare; but
this fluttered and trembled when Thor came. Hrungner
had a heart of hard stone, sharp and three-cornered;
his head was also of stone, and likewise his
shield, which was broad and thick, and this shield he
held before himself when he stood at Grjottungard
waiting for Thor. His weapon was a flint-stone, which
he swung over his shoulders, so that it was no trifle to
join in combat with him. By his side stood the clay-giant,
that is called Mokkerkalfe (<i>Mökkrkálfi</i>), and was
so extremely terrified that the sweat poured from off
him. Thor went to the holmgang together with Thjalfe,
a servant, whom he had got from a peasant by the sea.
Thjalfe ran to the place where Hrungner was standing,
and said to him: You stand unguarded, giant; you
hold the shield before you, but Thor has seen you; he
comes with violence from beneath the earth and attacks
you. Then Hrungner hastily put the shield beneath his
feet and stood on it, but he seized his flint-stone with
both hands. Presently he saw flashes of lightning and
heard loud crashings, and then he saw Thor in his asamight,
rushing forward with impetuous speed, swinging
his hammer and throwing it from the distance against
Hrungner. The latter lifted the flint-stone with both
his hands and threw it with all his might against the
hammer; the two met in the air and the flint-stone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>broke into two pieces, one piece of which fell on the
ground (and hence the flint mountains), while the other
fell with such force against the head of Thor that he
fell forward to the ground; but the hammer Mjolner
hit Hrungner right in the head and crushed his skull
into small pieces, he himself falling over Thor, so that
his foot lay across Thor’s neck. Thjalfe contended with
Mokkerkalfe, who fell with little honor. Then Thjalfe
went over to Thor, and was going to take Hrungner’s
foot away, but he was not able to do it. Thereupon
came all the gods to Grjottungard, when they had learned
that Thor had fallen, but neither was any one of them
able to remove the foot of the giant. Then came
Magne (<i>magni</i>, strength), the son of Thor and Jarnsaxa;
he was only three nights old and he threw
Hrungner’s foot off from Thor saying: It was a great
mishap, father, that I came so late; this giant, I think,
I could have slain with my fist. Thor stood up and
lovingly greeted his son, adding that he would give
him the giant’s horse Goldfax; but Odin remarked that
this was wrongfully done of Thor to give the son of a
hag (<i>gýgjar syni</i>, son of Jarnsaxa) and not his father
so excellent a horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thor returned home to Thrudvang, and the flint-stone
sat fast in his head. Then came a sorceress,
whose name was Groa, wife of Orvandel the Wise; she
sang her magic songs over Thor until the flint-stone
became loose. But when Thor perceived this, and was
just expecting that the stone would disappear, he desired
to reward Groa for her cure, and gladden her heart.
He accordingly related to her how he had waded from
the north over the rivers Elivagar and had borne Orvandel
on his back in a basket from Jotunheim; and
in evidence he told her that one toe of Orvandel had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>protruded from the basket and had frozen, wherefore he
had broken it off and thrown it up into the sky and
made of it the star which is called Orvandel’s toe.
Finally he added that it would not be long before Orvandel
would come home again. But Groa became so
delighted with this news that she forgot all her magic
songs and the flint-stone became no looser than it was,
and it sticks fast in Thor’s head yet. Therefore no one
must throw a flint-stone across the floor, for then the
stone in Thor’s head is moved. Thus sings the Skald,
Thjodolf of Hvin:</p>

      <div class='line'>To the meeting with Hrungner.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The most prominent feature of this myth is the
lightning which strikes down among the rocks and
splits them. Hrungner (from <i>hruga</i>, to wrinkle, to heap
up) is the naked, wrinkled mountains with their peaks.
Everything is made of stone. Hrungner’s heart and
head and shield and weapon were all of stone; beside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>him stands the clayey mountain (Mokkerkalfe) clad in
mist (<i>mökkr</i>), and the contest is at Grjottungard, on the
boundary of the stone-covered field. Thor crushes the
mountain to make way for agriculture. Thjalfe is the
untiring labor, which prepares the rock for cultivation.
He advises Hrungner to protect himself from below
with his shield. The cultivation of the mountain must
begin at the foot of it; there labors the industrious
farmer. When he looks up the mountain lifts its rocky
head like a huge giant of stone, but the clouds gather
around the giant’s head, the lightnings flash and split
it. Thjalfe may also be regarded as a concomitant of
the thunderstorm, and would then represent the pouring
rain, as Thor had got him from a peasant by the
sea, and he contends with the mountain of clay, from
which the water pours down. Thor’s forehead may also
represent the face of the earth, from which he rises as
the son of earth, and we know that Minerva sprang
forth full-grown and equipped from the brain of Zeus.
Orvandel<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> and Groa (to grow) refer to the seed sprouting
(Orvandel) and growing. Thor carries the seed in
his basket over the ice-cold streams (Elivagar), that is,
he preserves plant-life through the winter; the sprout
ventures out too early in the spring and a toe freezes
off; and it is a beautiful idea that the gods make shining
stars of everything in the realm of giants that has
became useless on earth, and what more charming theme
can the painter ask for than Thor carrying on his divine
shoulders the reckless Orvandel wading through the ice
streams of winter?</p>

<p class='c004'>Before proceeding to the next myth, we will pause
here for a moment and take a cursory look at history, to
see whether a few outlines of it do not find their completest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>reflection in this stone-hearted myth about
Hrungner and Thor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hrungner on his horse <i>Goldfax</i>, racing with Odin and
Sleipner, in the most perfect manner represents the
Roman <i>poetastry</i>, reveling in the <i>wealth</i> robbed from the
nations of the earth, in rivalry with the genuine Greek
<i>poetry</i> and philosophy; for Sleipner is Pegasos; and
when the Roman poetasters are in the hight of their
glory Hrungner is entertained at Asgard, drunk and
crazy, bragging and swearing that he will put all the gods
to death excepting Sif (Fortuna) and Freyja (Venus),
destroy Asgard and move Valhal to Jotunheim; or, in
other words, Venus and Fortuna are the only divinities
that shall be worshiped; all religion (Asgard) shall be
rooted out and history (Valhal) shall only serve to glorify
Rome.</p>

<p class='c004'>But in the course of time the North begins to take
part in determining the destinies of the world; Thor
comes home, and shortly afterwards a duel is fought
between the Goth and Roman (Vandal) in which Rome is
worsted, which could not be expressed more fitly than by
the fortunate blow of Mjolner, which crushes the stone-hearted
and stone-headed Giant (Roman Vandalism).</p>

<p class='c004'>But the Goth becomes Romanized, he becomes a slave
of Roman thought and Roman civilization, and thus
Hrungner falls upon Thor, with his foot upon Thor’s
neck, until his son Magne comes and takes it away.
Magne is the Anglo-Saxon who created a Gothic Christianity
and a Gothic book-speech; and well might the
Anglo-Saxon be called Magne, son of Asathor and the
hag Jarnsaxa, for Magne is the mythical representation
of the mechanical arts, which have received their most
perfect development in England and America (the Anglo-Saxons).
And we need only to look at the literature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>England and America to observe with what pleasure
Magne (the Anglo-Saxon) is a great child, who rides the
horse Goldfax (the Latin language), at which Odin (the
Goth) may well complain that it was wrongfully done,
although the spirit of the North (Odin) might rather
envy the horse (Romanism) its rider than the rider (the
Anglo-Saxon) his horse.</p>

<p class='c004'>In regard to the piece of flint-stone that remained
in Thor’s forehead, and sticks there yet, we know, alas!
that it is too true that the schools and the literature of all
the Teutonic races suffer more or less from the curse of
Romanism; and this they suffer in spite of the German
sorceress Groa (Luther), who in the sixteenth century
loosened the ugly Roman popery in Thor’s forehead,
without his getting rid of it; for he began boasting too
soon, and Groa (the Lutheran Reformation) became so
glad on account of her husband with his frozen toe
(German scholasticism and soulless philosophy elevated to
the skies), that she forgot not her Latin but her magic
Teutonic songs; and hence we look in vain for a complete
system of German mythology and old German poetry.</p>

<p class='c004'>Who the Mokkerkalfe who assisted Hrungner is, in
this picture, it is difficult to say, unless it be the Arab,
and he may well be called a brother of the Roman
(Hrungner) against Thor. The Mokkerkalfe had a
mare’s heart in him, and we know that love of horses
has forever been a characteristic of the Arabs; and the
Frank, who defeated the Arab on the historical arena,
must then be Thjalfe, who was a servant of Thor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus this myth is disposed of and its application
in a prophetic sense has been pointed out. It is not
claimed that the ancient Norsemen had in their minds
Arabs and Greeks and Romans and Franks and Anglo-Saxons,
but that they had in their minds a profound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>comprehension of the relations of things, the supreme
law of the universe; and history is but the reflection
of the sublimest riddles in nature.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. THOR AND GEIRROD.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a></h4>
<p class='c006'>It is worth relating how Thor made a journey to
Geirrodsgard without his hammer Mjolner, or belt
Megingjarder, or his iron gloves; and that was Loke’s
fault. For when Loke once, in Frigg’s falcon-guise,
flew out to amuse himself, curiosity led him to Geirrodsgard,
where he saw a large hall. He sat down and
looked in through an opening in the wall, but Geirrod
observed him and ordered one of his servants to seize
the bird and bring it to him. But the wall was so
high that it was difficult to climb up, and it amused
Loke that it gave the servant so much trouble, and he
thought was time enough to fly away when the servant
had got over the worst. As the latter now caught
at him, he spread his wings and made efforts (stritted)
with his feet, but the feet were fast, so that he was
seized and brought to the giant. When the latter saw
his eyes he mistrusted that it was no bird; and when
Loke was silent and refused to answer the questions put
to him, Geirrod locked him down in a chest and let
him hunger for three months. Thus Loke finally had
to confess who he was, and to save his life he had to
make an oath to Geirrod that he should get Thor to
Geirrodsgard without his hammer or his belt of strength.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the way Thor visited the hag Grid, mother of
Vidar the Silent. She informed him, in regard to
Geirrod, that he was a dogwise and dangerous giant, and
she lent him her belt of strength, her iron gloves and
her staff, which is called Gridarvold. Thor then went to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the river Vimer, which is exceedingly large; then he
buckled the belt around him and stemmed the wild
torrent with his staff, but Loke and Thjalfe held themselves
fast in the belt. When he had come into the
middle of the river it grew so much that the waves
washed over his shoulders. Then quoth Thor:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>Wax not, Vimer,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since to wade I desire</div>
      <div class='line'>To the realms of giants!</div>
      <div class='line'>Know, if thou waxest</div>
      <div class='line'>Then waxes my asamight</div>
      <div class='line'>As high as the heavens!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Up in a cleft he saw Geirrod’s daughter, Gjalp, who
stood on both sides of the stream and caused its growth;
then took he a large stone and threw after her. At
its source the stream must be stemmed, and he always
hit what he aimed at. At the same time he reached
the land and got hold of a shrub, and so he escaped out
of the river; hence comes the adage that a shrub saved
Thor. When Thor with his companions had now come
to Geirrod, lodgings were given them in a house, but
there was only one chair in it, and on this Thor sat
down. Then he noticed that the chair was raised under
him toward the roof. He then put Grid’s staff against
the beams and pressed himself down against the chair;
then a noise was heard, upon which followed a great
screaming, for Geirrod’s daughters, Gjalp and Greip, had
been sitting under the chair and he had broken the
backs of both or them. Then quoth Thor:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Then Geirrod invited Thor into the hall to see games.
Large fires burned along the hall, and when Thor had
come opposite to Geirrod the latter took with a pair of
tongs a red-hot iron wedge and threw it after Thor; he
seized it with the iron gloves and lifted it up into the
air, but Geirrod ran behind an iron post to defend himself.
Thor threw the wedge, which struck through the
post and through Geirrod and through the wall, so that
it went outside and into the ground.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='4'>IV</abbr>. THOR AND SKRYMER.</h4>
<p class='c006'>One day the god Thor, accompanied by Loke, set
out on a journey in his car drawn by his goats. Night
coming on, they put up at a peasant’s cottage, when
Thor killed his goats, and, after flaying them, put them
in a kettle. When the flesh was boiled he sat down
with his fellow-traveler to supper, and invited the peasant
and his wife and their children to partake of the repast.
The peasant’s son was named Thjalfe and his daughter
Roskva. Thor bade them throw all the bones into the
goats’ skins, which were spread out near the fireplace,
but young Thjalfe broke one of the shank-bones to
come at the marrow. Thor having passed the night in
the cottage, rose at the dawn of day, and when he had
dressed himself he took his hammer, Mjolner, and, lifting
it up, consecrated the goats’ skins, which he had
no sooner done than the two goats reassumed their
wonted form, with the exception that one of them
limped on one of its hind legs. Thor, perceiving this,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>said that the peasant or one of his family had handled
the shank-bone of this goat too roughly, for he saw
clearly that it was broken. It may readily be imagined
how frightened the peasant was, when he saw Thor
knit his brows and seize the handle of his hammer with
such force that the knuckles of his fingers grew white
with the exertion. But the peasant, as we might expect,
and his whole family, screamed aloud, sued for peace,
and offered all they possessed as an atonement for the
offense committed. But when Thor saw their fright he
desisted from his wrath and became appeased, and he
contented himself by requiring their children, Thjalfe and
Roskva, who thus became his servants and have accompanied
him ever since. Thor let his goats remain there,
and proceeded eastward on the way to Jotunheim clear
to the sea. Then he went across the deep ocean, and
when he came to the other shore he landed with Loke,
Thjalfe and Roskva. They had traveled but a short distance
when they came to a large forest, through which
they wandered until night set in. Thjalfe was exceedingly
fleet-footed; he carried Thor’s provision-sack, but the
forest was a bad place for finding anything eatable to
stow into it. When it had become dark they looked
around for lodgings for the night and found a house.
It was very large, with a door that took up the whole
breadth of one of the ends of the building; here they
chose them a place to sleep in. At midnight they were
alarmed by a great earthquake. The earth trembled
beneath them and the whole house shook. Then Thor
stood up and called his companions to seek with him a
place of safety. On the right they found an adjoining
chamber, into which they entered; but while the others,
trembling with fear, crept into the farthest corner of this
retreat, Thor remained in the doorway, with his hammer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>in his hand, prepared to defend himself whatever might
happen. Then they heard a rumbling and roaring.
When the morning began to dawn, Thor went out and
saw a man lying a short distance from the house in the
woods. The giant was large, lay sleeping, and snored
loudly. Then Thor could understand whence the noise
had come in the night. He girded himself with his
belt of strength, and his divine strength grew; at the
same time the man awoke and arose hastily. But it is
related that Thor on this occasion became so amazed that
he forgot to make use of his mallet; he asked the man
for his name, however. The latter answered that his
name was Skrymer; but your name I do not need to ask
about, said he; I know you are Asathor; but what
have you done with my mitten? Thereupon Skrymer
stretched out his hand and picked up his mitten, which
Thor then perceived was what they had taken over night
for a house, the chamber where they had taken refuge
being the thumb. Skrymer asked whether Thor wanted
him for a traveling companion, and when Thor consented
to this, Skrymer untied his provision-sack and
began to eat his breakfast. Thor and his companions
did the same in another place. Then Skrymer proposed
that they should put their provisions together, and when
Thor gave his consent to this, Skrymer put all the food
into one sack and slung it on his back. He went before
them all day with tremendous strides, but toward evening
he sought out for them a place where they might pass
the night, beneath a large oak. Then said Skrymer to
Thor that he was going to lie down to sleep; the others
might in the meantime take the provision-sack and prepare
their supper. Then Skrymer fell asleep, and snored
tremendously, and Thor took the provision-sack to untie
it; but, incredible though it may appear, not a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>knot could he untie, nor render a single string looser
than it was before. Seeing that his labor was in vain,
Thor became angry, seized the hammer Mjolner with
both hands, went over to Skrymer and struck him on
the head. But Skrymer awoke and asked whether there
had fallen a leaf down upon his head, and whether they
had eaten their supper and were ready to go to sleep?
Thor answered that they were just going to sleep, and
went to lie down under another oak, but also here it was
dangerous to sleep. At midnight Thor again heard how
fast Skrymer slept and snored, so outrageously that a
thundering noise was heard through the whole woods.
Arising he went over to the giant, swung his hammer
with all his might, and struck him right in the skull,
and the hammer entered the head clear to the handle.
Skrymer, suddenly awakening, said: What is the matter
now? Did an acorn fall down upon my head?
How is it with you, Thor. Thor went hastily away
and said that he had just waked up; it was midnight,
he said, and time to sleep. Then thought he that if
he could get an opportunity to give the giant a third
blow he should never see the light of day any more,
and he now lay watching to see whether Skrymer was
fast asleep again. Shortly before day-break he heard
that the giant was sleeping again. He got up, hastened
over to him, swung his hammer with all his
might, and gave him  such a blow on the temples that
the head of the hammer was buried in the giant’s head.
Skrymer arose, stroked his chin and said: Do there sit
birds above me in the tree? It seemed to me as I awoke
that some moss fell down upon me out of the boughs;
but are you awake, Thor? It seems to me that it is
time to arise and dress, and you have not now a long
journey to the castle which is called Utgard. I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>heard you have whispered among yourselves that I am
not small of stature, but you shall find larger men when
you come to Utgard. I am going to give you good
advice: do not brag too much. Utgard-Loke’s courtiers
will not brook the boasting of such insignificant little
fellows as you are. If you will not heed his advice
you had better turn back, and that is in fact the best
thing for you to do. But if you are determined to
go further then hold to the east; my way lies northward
to those mountains that you see yonder. Skrymer
then taking the provision-sack, slung it on his
back and disappeared in the woods, and it has never
been learned whether the asas wished to meet him again
or not.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thor now went on with his companions till it was
noon, when their eyes beheld a castle standing on a
great plain, and it was so high that they had to bend
their necks quite back in order to be able to look over
it. They advanced to the castle; there was a gate to
the entrance, which was locked. Thor tried to open it,
but could not, and being anxious to get within the
castle, they crept between the bars of the gate. They
saw the palace before them, the door was open, and
they entered, where they saw a multitude of men, of
whom the greater number were immensely large, sitting
on two benches. Then they came into the presence of
the king, Utgard-Loke, and saluted him; but it took
some time before he would deign to look at them, and
he smiled scornfully, so that one could see his teeth,
saying: It is tedious to ask for tidings of a long journey,
but if I am not mistaken this little stripling must
be Asathor; perhaps, however, you are really bigger
than you look. Well, what are the feats that you and
your companions are skilled in? No one is tolerated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>among us here unless he distinguishes himself by some
art or accomplishment. Then said Loke: I understand
an art, of which I am prepared to give proof, and that
is, that there is none here who can eat his food as fast
as I can. To this Utgard-Loke made reply: Truly that
is an art, if you can achieve it, which we shall now see.
He called to the men, who sat on one end of the bench,
that he, whose name was Loge (flame), should come
out on the floor and contend with Loke. A trough
was brought in full of meat. Loke seated himself at
one end and Loge at the other; both ate as fast as they
could and met in the middle of the trough. Loke had
picked the meat from the bones, but Loge had consumed
meat, bones and trough all together; and now
all agreed that Loke was beaten. Then asked Utgard-Loke,
what that young man could do. It was Thjalfe.
He answered, that he would run a race with any one
that Utgard-Loke would appoint. Utgard-Loke replied
that this was a splendid feat, but added that he must
be very swift if he expected to win, but they should
see, for it would soon be decided. Utgard-Loke arose
and went out; there was a very good race-course on
the level field.  Then he called a little fellow, by name
Huge (thought) and bade him race with Thjalfe. The
first time they ran Huge was so much in advance that
at the turning back in the course he met Thjalfe.  You
must ply your legs better, Thjalfe, said Utgard-Loke, if
you expect to win, though I must confess that there
never came a man here swifter of foot than you are.
They ran a second time, but when Huge came to the
end and turned around, Thjalfe was a full bow-shot
from the goal. Well run, both of you, said Utgard-Loke,
but I think Thjalfe will hardly win, but the
third race shall decide it. They accordingly ran a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>third time, but Huge had already reached the goal
before Thjalfe had got half-way. Then all who were
present cried out that there had been sufficient trial of
skill in this art. Utgard-Loke then asked Thor in what
arts he would choose to give proof of his skill for
which he was so famous. Thor answered that he preferred
to contend in drinking with any one that wished.
Utgard-Loke consented, and entering the palace he called
his cup-bearer, and bade him bring the large horn which
his courtiers were obliged to drink out of when they
had trespassed in any way against established usage.
The cup-bearer brought the horn, gave it to Thor, and
Utgard-Loke said: Whoever is a good drinker will empty
that horn at a single draught, though some men make
two of it; but there is no so wretched drinker that he
cannot exhaust it at the third draught. Thor looked
at the horn and thought it was not large, though tolerably
long; however, as he was very thirsty he set it
to his lips, and without drawing breath drank as long
and as deep as he could, in order that he might not be
obliged to make a second draught of it. But when his
breath gave way and he set the horn down, he saw to
his astonishment that there was little less of the liquor
in it than before. Utgard-Loke said: That is well
drunk, but not much to boast of; I should never have
believed but that Asathor could have drunk more; however,
of this I am confident, you will empty it at the
second draught. Thor made no reply, but put the horn
to his mouth and drank as long as he had breath, but
the point of the horn did not rise as he expected; and
when he withdrew the horn from his mouth it seemed
to him that its contents had sunk less this time than
the first; still the horn could now be carried without
spilling. Utgard-Loke said: How now, Thor, have you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>not saved for the third draught more than you can make
away with? You must not spare yourself more in performing
a feat than befits your skill, but if you mean
to drain the horn at the third draught you must drink
deeply. You will not be considered so great a man
here as you are thought to be among the asas if you
do not show greater skill in other games than you appear
to have shown in this. Then Thor became angry,
put the horn to his mouth, and drank with all his
might, so as to empty it entirely; but on looking into
the horn he found that its contents had lessened but
little, upon which he resolved to make no further attempt,
but gave back the horn to the cup-bearer. Then
said Utgard-Loke: It is now plain that your strength
is not so great as we thought it to be. Will you try
some other games, for we see that you cannot succeed
in this? Yes, said Thor, I will try something else, but
I am sure that such draughts as I have been drinking
would not have been counted small among the asas, but
what new trial have you to propose? Utgard-Loke
answered: We have a very trifling game here, in which
we exercise none but children. Young men think it
nothing but play to lift my cat from the ground, and I
should never have proposed this to Asathor if I had not
already observed that you are by no means what we
took you for. Thereupon a large gray cat ran out upon
the floor. Thor advancing put his hand under the cat’s
body and did his utmost to raise it from the floor, but
the cat, bending its back in the same degree as Thor
lifted, had notwithstanding all Thor’s efforts only one
of its feet lifted up, seeing which Thor made no further
effort. Then said Utgard-Loke: The game has
terminated just as I expected; the cat is large, but
Thor is small and little compared with our men. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>said Thor: Little as you call me I challenge any one to
wrestle with me, for now I am angry. I see no one here,
replied Utgard-Loke, looking around on the benches,
who would not think it beneath him to wrestle with
you; but let somebody call hither that old woman, my
nurse, Elle (old age), and let Thor prove his strength
with her, if he will. She has thrown to the ground
many a man not less strong and mighty than Thor is.
A toothless old woman then entered the hall and she
was told by Utgard-Loke to wrestle with Thor. To cut
the story short, the more Thor tightened his hold the
firmer she stood. Finally, after a violent struggle, Thor
began to lose his footing, and it was not long before
he was brought down on one knee. Then Utgard-Loke
stepped forward and told them to stop, adding that Thor
had now no occasion to ask anyone else in the hall to
wrestle with him, and it was also getting late. He
therefore showed Thor and his companions to their
seats, and they passed the night there enjoying the best
of hospitality.</p>

<p class='c004'>The next morning, at break of day, Thor and his
companions arose, dressed themselves and prepared for
their departure. Utgard-Loke then came and ordered a
table to be set for them, on which there wanted no good
provisions, either meat or drink. When they had breakfasted
they set out on their way. Utgard-Loke accompanied
them out of the castle, and on parting he asked
Thor how he thought his journey had turned out, and
whether he had found any man more mighty than himself.
Thor answered that he could not deny that he
had brought great dishonor upon himself; and what
mortifies me the most, he added, is that you will consider
me a man of little importance. Then said Utgard-Loke:
Now I will tell you the truth, since you are out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>of my castle, where as long as I live and reign you
shall never re-enter, and you may rest assured that had
I known before what might you possessed, and how near
you came plunging us into great trouble, I would not
have permitted you to enter this time. Know then that
I have all along deceived you by my illusions; first, in
the forest, where I arrived before you, and there you
were unable to untie the provision-sack, because I had
bound it with tough iron wire in such a manner that you
could not discover how the knot ought to be loosened.
After this you gave me three blows with your hammer;
the first one, though it was the least, would have ended
my days had it fallen on me, but I brought a rocky
mountain before me, which you did not perceive; but
you saw near my castle a mountain in which were
three square glens, the one deeper than the other, and
those were the marks of your hammer. I have made
use of similar illusions in the contests you have had
with my courtiers. In the first, Loke was hungry and
devoured all that was set before him, but Loge was in
reality nothing else but wild-fire, and therefore consumed
not only the meat, but the trough which contained
it. Huge, with whom Thjalfe contended in
running, was my thought, and it was impossible for
Thjalfe to keep pace with it. When you tried to empty
the horn you performed indeed an exploit so marvelous
that had I not seen it myself I should never have
believed it. The one end of the horn stood in the sea,
which you did not perceive, and when you come to the
shore you will see how much the ocean has diminished
by what you drank. This is now called the ebb. You
performed a feat no less wonderful when you lifted the
cat, and, to tell the truth, when we saw that one of his
paws was off the floor we were all of us terror-stricken,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>for what you took for a cat was in reality the great
Midgard-serpent, that encompasses the whole earth, and
he was then barely long enough to inclose it between
his head and tail, so high had your hand raised him up
toward heaven. Your wrestling with Elle was also a
most astonishing feat, for there never yet was, nor will
there ever be, a man for whom Old Age (for such in
fact was Elle) will not sooner or later lay low, if he
abides her coming. But now, as we are going to part,
let me tell you that it will be better for both of us if
you never come near me again, for should you do so I
shall again defend myself with other illusions, so that
you will never prevail against me. On hearing these
words Thor grasped his hammer, and lifted it into the
air, but as he was about to strike Utgard-Loke was
nowhere, and when he turned back to the castle to
destroy it, he saw only beautiful verdant plains around
him and no castle. He therefore retraced his steps without
stopping till he came to Thrudvang. But he had
already resolved to make that attack on the Midgard-serpent,
which afterwards took place.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is said in the Younger Edda that no one can tell
anything more <i>true</i> of this journey of Thor’s, but if the

<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='5'>V</abbr>. THOR AND THE MIDGARD-SERPENT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The gods were having a feast at Æger’s, and could
not get enough to eat and drink. The reason was that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Æger was in want of a kettle for brewing ale. He
asked Thor to go and fetch it, but neither the asas
nor the vans knew where it could be found, before
Tyr said to Thor: East of the rivers Elivagar, near
the borders of heaven, dwells the dogwise Hymer, and
this my father has a kettle which is strong and one
rast (mile) deep. Do you think we can get it? said
Thor. Yes, by stratagem it may be gotten, answered
Tyr. Tyr, and Thor under the semblance of a young
man, now started out and traveled until they came to
Egil. With him they left the goats and proceeded
further to Hymer’s hall, and we shall presently see how
Thor made amends for his journey to Utgard-Loke. At
Hymer’s hall Tyr found his grandmother, an ugly
giantess with nine hundred heads, but his mother, a
beautiful woman, brought him a drink. She advised
her guests to conceal themselves under the kettles in
the hall, for her husband was sometimes cruel toward
strangers. Hymer came home from his fishing late in
the evening; the jokuls resounded as he entered the
hall, and his beard was full of frost. I greet you welcome
home, Hymer, said the woman; our son, whom
we have been so long expecting, has now come home to
your halls, and in company with him is the enemy of
the giants and the friend of man, Veor (<i>i.e.</i> Asgardsveor,
the protector of Asgard). See how they have concealed
themselves at the gable end of the hall, behind the post
yonder. Hymer threw a glance in the direction pointed
out by his wife, and the post instantly flew into shivers
at the look of the giant, the beam broke, and eight kettles
fell down; one so hard and strong that it did
not break in falling. The gods came forth, and straight
the old giant gazed at his enemy. It was no pleasant
sight to see Thor before him, but still he ordered three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>steers to be killed and served on the table. Thor alone
ate two. This meal seemed to the friend of Hrungner
somewhat extravagant, and he remarked that the next
evening they would have to live on fish. The following
morning, at break of day, when Thor perceived that
Hymer was making a boat ready for fishing, he arose
and dressed himself, and begged the giant to let him row
out to sea with him. Hymer answered that such a puny
stripling as he was could be of no use to him; besides, he
said, you will catch your death of cold if I go far out
and remain as long as I am accustomed to do. Thor said
that for all that he would row as far from the land as
Hymer had a mind, and was not sure which of them
would be the first who might wish to row back again.
At the same time he was so enraged that he was much
inclined to let his hammer ring at the giant’s skull
without further delay, but intending to try his strength
elsewhere he subdued his wrath, and asked Hymer what
he meant to bait with. Hymer told him to look out for
a bait himself. Thor instantly went up to a herd of
oxen that belonged to the giant, and seizing the largest
bull, that bore the name Himinbrjoter (heaven-breaker),
wrung off his head, and returning with it to the boat,
put out to sea with Hymer. Thor rowed aft with two
oars, and with such force that Hymer, who rowed at the
prow, saw with surprise how swiftly the boat was driven
forward. He then observed that they were come to the
place where he was wont to angle for flat-fish, but Thor
assured him that they had better go on a good way further.
They accordingly continued to ply their oars, until
Hymen cried out that if they did not stop they would be
in danger from the great Midgard-serpent. Notwithstanding
this, Thor persisted in rowing further, and in
spite of Hymer’s remonstrances it was a long time before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>he would lay down his oars. When they finally stopped,
Hymer soon drew up two whales at once with his bait.
Then Thor took out a fishing line, extremely strong,
made with wonderful art and furnished with an equally
strong hook, on which he fixed the bull’s head and cast
his line into the sea. The bait soon reached the bottom,
and it may be truly said that Thor then deceived the
Midgard-serpent not a whit less than Utgard-Loke had
deceived Thor when he obliged him to lift up the serpent
in his hand; for the monster greedily caught at
the bait and the hook stuck fast in his palate. Stung
with the pain, the serpent tugged at the hook so violently
that Thor was obliged to hold fast with both hands in
the pegs that bear against the oars. But his wrath now
waxed high, and assuming all his divine power he pulled
so hard at the line that his feet forced their way through
the boat and went down to the bottom of the sea, while
with his hands he drew up the serpent to the side of the
vessel. It is impossible to express by words the scene
that now took place. Thor on the one hand darting
looks of wrath at the serpent, while the monster on the
other hand, rearing his head, spouted out floods of venom
upon him. When the giant Hymer beheld the serpent
he turned pale and trembled with fright, and seeing
moreover that the water was entering his boat on all
sides, he took out his knife, just as Thor raised his
hammer aloft, and cut the line, on which the serpent
sank again under water. According to another version
valiant Thor hauled the venom-potted serpent up
to the edge of the boat, his hands struck against the
side of the boat and with both his feet he stepped
through, so that he stood on the bottom of the sea.
With his hammer he struck the serpent in the forehead;
the mountains thundered, the caves howled, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>whole old earth shrank together; but the serpent sank to
the bottom, for at the sight of it the giant became so
terrified that he cut the line. Then, according to both
versions, Thor struck Hymer such a blow on the ear
with his fist that the giant fell headlong into the water.
The giant was not glad when they rowed back. While
he carried his two whales, Thor took the boat, with
oars and all, and carried it to the house of the giant.
Then the giant challenged Thor to show another evidence
of his strength and requested him to break his goblet.
Thor, sitting, threw it through some large posts, but
it was brought whole to the giant. But Thor’s fair
friend gave him friendly advice: Throw it against the
forehead of Hymer, said she, it is harder than any
goblet. Then Thor assumed his asastrength. The
giant’s forehead remained whole, but the round wine-goblet
was broken. The giant had lost a great treasure;
that drink, said he, was too hot; but there yet remained
for Thor one trial of his strength, and that was to bring
the kettle out of his hall. Twice Tyr tried to lift it, but
it was immovable. Then Thor himself took hold of it
at the edge with so great force that he stepped through
the floor of the hall; the kettle he lifted onto his head,
and its rings rung at his heels. They had gone a long
distance before Odin’s son looked back and saw a many-headed
multitude rushing impetuously from the caves
with Hymer. Then he lifted the kettle from his shoulders,
swung the murderous Mjolner and slew all the
mountain-giants. After that he proceeded to Egil, where
he had left his goats; and he had not gone far thence
before one of the goats dropped down half dead. It was
lame, and we remember from a previous myth that a
peasant near the sea had to give Thor his son Thjalfe and
daughter Roskva as bond-servants for laming one of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>goats. Thor finally came to the feast of the gods and
had the kettle with him, and there was nothing now to
hinder Æger from furnishing ale enough at the feast,
that he prepared for the gods at every harvest time.</p>

<p class='c004'>This myth forms the subject of the lay of Hymer
in the Elder Edda. The whole myth of course represents
the thunderstorm in conflict with the raging
sea; but a historical counterpart of this struggle of
Thor with Hymer and the Midgard-serpent is so forcibly
suggested that we cannot omit it. It is Luther’s
struggle with the pope Romanism. Luther, the
heroic Thor, saw his enemy, but did not strike just in
the right time and in the right way, and the golden
opportunity was lost after Hymer (the pope) had severed
the fishing-line; that is after the old memories
were destroyed, when the golden line connecting the
Germans with their poetic dawn had been divided, and
Romanism, with blood-stained breast, with close embrace
first twined around the whole school system of
Germany and north Europe, and horribly mangled their
grand mission with its fangs, and then seized the Teutonic
Laocoon and his sons and bound their unsophisticated
Teutonic hearts in its mighty folds. Ay, this
<i>Roman</i> Midgard-serpent, with its licentiousness, arrogance,
despotism, unbridled ambition, unbounded egotism,
dry reasoning and soulless philosophy, has grasped
the <i>Goth</i> twice, yes thrice, about the middle, and
winding its scaly book thrice around his neck, has overtopped
him. In vain he has striven to tear asunder
its knotted and gory spires. He can but shriek to
heaven for help, and may Thor hear his cry and come
to his rescue! May Thor next time embark well armed
with his gloves and belt and hammer; but he had better
leave the giant slain on shore. Yet Luther did a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>noble work. Although his first intention was to leave
the giant unmolested, and only take his kettle from
him, still, when he found a determined opposition threatening,
he turned around, set down his kettle, and slew
both the giant and the many-headed multitude (pope,
cardinals, bishops, etc.) that followed him. But Luther
erred in not establishing a thoroughly Teutonic in place
of a Romanic school system. Thus he left his great
work only half finished. If he had made good use of
his hammer at the time, much valuable knowledge about
our Teutonic ancestors might have been collected and
preserved which now is lost forever.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thrym (from <i>þruma</i>) is the noisy, thundering imitator
of Thor. While the thunder sleeps, the giant
forces of nature howl and rage in the storms and
winds, they have stolen the hammer from Thor. Thor
goes and brings his hammer back and the storms are
made to cease. It has been suggested that Thor is the
impersonation of truth, and the Younger Edda speaks
of him as one <i>never having yet uttered an</i> <span class='fss'>UNTRUTH</span>.
It has also been claimed that the name of his realm
<i>Thrud</i>-vang contains the same root as our English
word <i>truth</i>, but this we leave for the reader to examine
for himself. Before the Norsemen learned to make the
sign of the cross, they made the sign of the hammer
upon themselves and upon other things that they
thereby wished to secure against evil influences.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now let us glance at the last appearance of Thor
on the stage of this world. The Norse king, Olaf the
saint, was eagerly pursuing his work of Christian reform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>in Norway, and we find him sailing with fit escort
along the western shore of that county from haven to
haven, dispensing justice or doing other royal work.
On leaving a certain haven, it is found that a stranger
of grave eyes and aspect, with red beard and of a
robust and stately figure, has stepped in. The courtiers
address him; his answers surprise by their pertinency
and depth. At length he is brought to the king. The
strangers conversation here is not less remarkable, as
they sail along the beautiful shore; but after awhile
he addresses King Olaf thus: Yes, King Olaf, it is
all beautiful, with the sun shining on it there; green,
fruitful, a right fair home for you; and many a sore
day had Thor, many a wild fight with the mountain
giants, before he could make it so.  And now you seem
minded to put away Thor. King Olaf, have a care!
said the stranger, knitting his brows; and when they
looked again he was nowhere to be found. This is
the last myth of Thor, a protest against the advance
of Christianity, no doubt reproachfully set forth by
some conservative pagan.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>
  <h3 id='chap2-5' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='5'>V</abbr>. <br /> VIDAR.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>On the way to Geirrod (see <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> <a href='#Page_310'>310</a>) we noticed that
Thor visited the hag Grid, and she lent him
three things, counterparts of Thor’s own treasures, her
belt of strength, iron gloves and staff. Grid belongs to
the race of giants; she dwells in the wild, unsubdued
nature, but is not hostile toward the gods. Her belt,
gloves and staff, her name, the place where she dwells
between Asgard and Jotunheim, her ability to give
Thor information about Geirrod, all give evidence of her
wild and powerful character.</p>

<p class='c004'>She is the mother of Vidar, who is a son of Odin.
Hence we have here, as in the case of Tyr, a connecting
link between the giants and asas. Through Tyr
the gods are related to the raging sea, through Vidar
to the wild desert and the forests. Vidar is surnamed
the Silent. He is almost as strong as Thor himself,
and the gods place great reliance on him in all critical
conjunctures. He is the brother of the gods. He has
an iron shoe; it is a thick shoe, of which it is said that
material has been gathered for it through all ages. It
is made of the scraps of leather that have have been cut off
from the toes and heels in cutting patterns for shoes.
These pieces must therefore be thrown away by the
shoemaker who desires to render assistance to the gods.
He is present at Æger’s feast, where Odin says to him:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>His realm is thus described in the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Grown over with shrubs</div>
      <div class='line'>And with high grass</div>
      <div class='line'>Is Vidar’s wide land.</div>
      <div class='line'>There sits Odin’s</div>
      <div class='line'>Son on the horse’s back:</div>
      <div class='line'>He will avenge his father.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He avenges his father in the final catastrophe, in Ragnarok;
for when the Fenris-wolf has swallowed Odin,
Vidar advances, and setting his foot on the monster’s
lower jaw he seizes the other with his hand, and thus
tears and rends him till he dies. It is now his shoe
does him such excellent service. After the universe
has been regenerated</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There dwell Vidar and Vale</div>
      <div class='line'>In the gods’ holy seats,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the fire of Surt is slaked.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Vidar’s name (from <i>viðr</i>, a forest) indicates that he
is the god of the primeval, impenetrable forest, where
neither the sound of the ax nor the voice of man was
ever heard; and hence he is also most fittingly surnamed
the Silent God. Vidar is, then, imperishable
and incorruptible nature represented as an immense
indestructible forest, with the iron trunks of the trees
rearing their dense and lofty tops toward the clouds.
Who has ever entered a thick and pathless forest, wandered
about in its huge shadows and lost himself in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>solemn darkness, without feeling deeply sensible to the
loftiness of the idea that underlies Vidar’s character.
Vidar is the Greek Pan, the representative of incorruptible
nature. He is not the ruler of the peaceful
grove near the abode of the gods, where Idun dwells,
but of the great and wild primeval forest, that man
never yet entered. The idea of Vidar’s woods is imperishableness,
while that of Idun’s grove is the constant
renovation and rejuvenation of the life of the
gods. The gods and all the work of their hands shall
perish, and it is nowhere stated that Idun survives
Ragnarok. Odin himself perishes, and with him all his
labor and care for man; but nature does not perish.
If that should be entirely destroyed, then it could not
be <i>regenerated</i>. If matter should perish, where would
then the spirit take its dwelling? If Vidar did not
exist, where would Vale be? The glory of the world,
the development that has taken place, and the spirit
revealed in it, perish; but not Vidar, for he is the imperishable,
wild, original nature, the eternal matter,
which reveals its force to, but is not comprehended by,
man; a force which man sees and reveres, without venturing
an explanation; but when all the works of man
are destroyed by consuming flames, this force of eternal
matter will be revealed with increased splendor.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus we find the power and strength of the gods
expressed in two myths, in Thor and in Vidar, both
sons of Odin, who is, as the reader knows, the father
of all the gods. Thor is the thundering, noisy, crushing,
but withal beneficent, god; Vidar is silent, dwells
far away from, and exercises no influence upon, the
works of man, except as he inspires a profound awe
and reverence. Thor is the visible, in their manifestations
wonderful, constantly returning and all-preserving,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>workings of nature; Vidar is the quiet, secretly
working, hidden and self-supporting imperishableness.
Popularity, fame, position, influence, wealth,—all that
makes so much stir and bustle in the world—shall
perish; but the quiet working of the soul, the honest
pursuit of knowledge, the careful secret development
of the powers of the human mind, shall live forever.
And Vidar and Vale (mind and knowledge) shall together
inhabit the sacred dwellings of the gods, when
the waves of time have ceased to roll: Vidar as the god
of imperishable matter, Vale as the god of eternal light
(spirit) that shines upon it.</p>

  <h3 id='chap2-6' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='6'>VI</abbr>. <br /> THE VANS.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='1'>I</abbr>. NJORD AND SKADE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Two opposite elements in nature are united in
order to produce life. The opposite elements are
expressed in the mythology by the terms asas and vans.
In our language and mode of expression that would
mean the solid and the liquid, the masculine and the
feminine.  Water, the <i>par excellence</i> representative of
liquids, may symbolize various ideas. It may typify
sorrow; it then manifests itself in tears, and sorrow is
fleeting as the flowing tears. Water may symbolize
gladness, happiness, and blessings, that flow in gushing
streams along the pathway of life; and it may also be
used as the symbol of innocence, purity, and wealth.
These ideas may be regarded as a general interpretation
of the vans, and we find them reflected in the triune
vana-deity; Njord with his children Frey and Freyja,
who rise from the sea and unite themselves with the
asa-divinity in heaven and on earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Njord is called Vanagod, and he dwells in the heavenly
region called Noatun. He rules over the winds and
checks the fury of the sea and of fire, and is therefore
invoked by seafarers and fishermen. He is so wealthy
that he can give possessions and treasures to those who
call on him for them. Yet Njord is not of the lineage
of the asas, for he was born and bred in Vanaheim.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>But the vans gave him as hostage to the asas, receiving
from them in his stead Hœner. By this means peace
was reëstablished between the asas and vans. (See
<a href='#chap2-1'>Part II, Chap. 1</a>, Sec. 13.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Njord took to wife Skade, the daughter of the giant
Thjasse.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a> She preferred dwelling in the abode formerly
belonging to her father, which is situated among rocky
mountains in the region called Thrymheim, but Njord
loved to reside near the sea. They at last agreed that
they should pass together nine nights in Thrymheim and
then three in Noatun. But one day when Njord came
back from the mountains to Noatun, he thus sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Am weary of the mountains,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not long was I there,</div>
      <div class='line'>Only nine nights:</div>
      <div class='line'>The howl of the wolves</div>
      <div class='line'>Methought sounded ill</div>
      <div class='line'>To the song of the swans.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To which Skade sang in reply:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sleep could I not</div>
      <div class='line'>On my sea-strand couch</div>
      <div class='line'>For screams of the sea-fowl.</div>
      <div class='line'><i>There</i> wakes me</div>
      <div class='line'>When from the wave he comes</div>
      <div class='line'>Every morn the mew (gull).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Skade then returned to the rocky mountains and
dwelt in Thrymheim. There fastening on her skees
and taking her bow she passes her time in the chase
of wild beasts, and is called Andre-dis (Skee-goddess).
Thus it is said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thrymheim it’s called</div>
      <div class='line'>Where Thjasse dwelled,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>That stream-mighty giant;</div>
      <div class='line'>But Skade now dwells,</div>
      <div class='line'>Skee-bride of the gods,</div>
      <div class='line'>In her father’s old mansion.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Njord is the god of the sea; that is to say, of that
part of the sea which is immediately connected with
the earth, that part of the sea which is made serviceable
to man, where fishing and commerce carried on.
His dwelling is Noatun, which means land of ships
(<i>nór</i>, ship; <i>tún</i>, yard, place). Njord’s realm is bounded
on the one side by the earth, the land, and on the
other by the raging ocean, where Æger with his daughters
reigns.  Njord’s wife is Skade (harm), the wild
mountain stream, which plunges down from the high
rocks, where she prefers to dwell, and pours herself
into the sea. Her dwelling is Thrymheim, the <i>roaring
home</i>, at the thundering waterfall. Taken as a whole,
the myth is very clear and simple.</p>

<p class='c004'>The compromise between Njord and Skate, to dwell
nine nights in Thrymheim (home of uproar, storms)
and three nights in Noatun, of course has reference to
the severe northern latitudes, where rough weather and
wintry storms prevail during the greater part of the
year.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. ÆGER AND RAN.</h4>
<p class='c006'>These do not belong to the vana-divinities, but are
given here in order to have the divinities of the sea in
one place. As Njord is the mild, beneficent sea near
the shore, so Æger is the wild, turbulent, raging sea
far from the land, where fishing and navigation cannot
well be carried on; the great ocean, and yet bordering
on the confines of then asas. Hence Æger’s twofold
nature; he is a giant, but still has intercourse with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>the gods. Thus in Mimer, Æger and Njord, we have
the whole ocean represented, from its origin, Mimer, to
its last stage of development, to Njord, in whom, as a
beneficent divinity, it unites itself with the gods; that
is to say, blesses and serves the enterprises of men.</p>

<p class='c004'>Æger visits the gods, and the latter visit him in
return; and it was once when the gods visited him
that his brewing-kettle was found too small, so that
Thor had to go to the giant Hymer and borrow a
larger one. In Æger’s hall the bright gold was used
instead of fire, and there the ale passed around spontaneously.
Ran is his wife. She has a net, in which
she catches those who venture out upon the sea. Æger
and Ran have nine daughters, the waves. Loke once
borrowed Ran’s net, to catch the dwarf Andvare, who
in the guise of a fish dwelt in a waterfall. With her
hand she is able to hold the ships fast. It was a
prevailing opinion among the ancient Norsemen that
they who perished at sea came to Ran; for Fridthjof,
who with his companions was in danger of being
wrecked, talks about his having to rest on Ran’s couch
instead of Ingeborg’s, and as it was not good to come
empty-handed to the halls of Ran and Æger, he divided
a ring of gold between himself and his men.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus Tegner has it in <i>Fridthjof</i> at Sea:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whirling cold and fast</div>
      <div class='line'>Snow-wreaths fill the sail;</div>
      <div class='line'>Over dock and mast</div>

      <div class='line'>So thick is darkness spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>As gloom and horror hover o’er</div>
      <div class='line'>The chamber of the dead.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>Still to sink the sailor dashes</div>
      <div class='line'>Implacable each angry wave;</div>
      <div class='line'>Gray, as if bestrewn with ashes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yawns the endless, awful grave.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then says Fridthjof:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For us in bed of ocean</div>
      <div class='line'>Azure pillows <i>Ran</i> prepares,</div>
      <div class='line'>On thy pillow, Ingeborg,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou thinkest upon me.</div>
      <div class='line'>Higher ply, my comrades,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ellida’s sturdy oars;</div>
      <div class='line'>Good ship, heaven-fashioned,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bear us on an hour.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The storm continues:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>O’er the side apace</div>
      <div class='line'>Now a sea hath leapt;</div>
      <div class='line'>In an instant’s space</div>
      <div class='line'>Clear the deck is swept.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From his arm now Fridthjof hastens</div>
      <div class='line'>To draw his ring, three marks in weight;</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the morning sun it glistens,</div>
      <div class='line'>The golden gift of Bele great.</div>
      <div class='line'>With his sword in pieces cutting</div>
      <div class='line'>The famous work of pigmied art,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shares he quickly, none forgetting,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unto every man a part.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then says Fridthjof again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Gold is good possession</div>
      <div class='line'>When one goes a-wooing;</div>
      <div class='line'>Let none go empty-handed</div>
      <div class='line'>Down to azure <i>Ran</i>.</div>
      <div class='line'>Icy are her kisses,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fickle her embraces;</div>
      <div class='line'>But we’ll charm the sea-bride</div>
      <div class='line'>With our ruddy gold.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>How eager Ran is to capture those who venture out
upon her domain is also illustrated in another part of
Fridthjof’s Saga, where King Ring and his queen Ingeborg
ride over the ice on the lake to a banquet.
Fridthjof went along on skates. Thus Tegner again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They speed as storms over ocean speed;</div>
      <div class='line'>The queen’s prayers little King Ring doth heed.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Their steel-shod comrade standeth not still,</div>
      <div class='line'>He flieth past them as swift as he will.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Many a rune on the ice cutteth he;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair Ingeborg’s name discovereth she.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So on their glittering course they go,</div>
      <div class='line'>But <i>Ran</i>, the traitress, lurketh below.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A hole in her silver roof she hath reft,</div>
      <div class='line'>Down sinketh the sleigh in the yawning cleft.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But, fortunately, Fridthjof was not far away. He
came to their rescue, and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>With a single tug he setteth amain</div>
      <div class='line'>Both steed and sleigh on the ice again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Of Æger’s and Ran’s daughters, the waves, it is said
that they congregate in large numbers according to the
will of their father. They have pale locks and white
veils; they are seldom mild in their disposition toward
men; they are called billows or surges, and are always
awake when the wind blows. They lash the sounding
shores, and angrily rage and break around the holms;<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
they have a hard bed (stones and rocks), and seldom
play in calm weather. The names of the daughters of
Æger and Ran represent the waves in their various
magnitudes and appearances. Thus Himinglœfa, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>sky-clear; Duva, the diver; Blodughadda, the bloody-
or purple-haired; Hefring, the swelling; Bylgja, billow;
Kolga, raging sea, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>These myths are very simple and need no extended
explanations. Æger is the Anglo-Saxon <i>eagor</i>, the sea.
He is also called Hler, the shelterer (<i>hlé</i>, Anglo-Saxon
<i>hleo</i>, Danish <i>Læ</i>, English <i>lee</i>), and Gymer, the concealing
(<i>geyma</i>, Anglo-Saxon <i>gyman</i>, Norse <i>gjemme</i>, to conceal,
to keep). These names express the sea in its uproar,
in its calmness, and as the covering of the deep.
The name of his wife, Ran (robbery or the robbing;
<i>rœna</i>, to plunder), denotes the sea as craving its sacrifice
of human life and of treasures. It is a common
expression in Norseland that the sea brews and seethes,
and this at once suggests Æger’s kettles. The foaming
ale needs no butler but passes itself around, and there
is plenty of it. That Æger, when visited by the gods,
illuminated his hall with shining gold, refers of course
to the phosphorescent light of the sea (Icelandic
<i>marelldr</i>, Norse <i>morild</i>). Those who are familiar with
the sea cannot fail to have seen the sparks of fire that
apparently fly from it when its surface is disturbed in
the dark. Thus the servants of Æger, Elde and Funfeng
(both words meaning fire), are properly called excellent
firemen. The relation between Njord and Æger
seems to be the same as between Okeanos, the great
water encircling the earth, and Pontus, the Mediterranean,
within the confines of the earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some of the old Norse heroes are represented as possessing
a terrifying helmet, Æger’s helmet (<i>gishjálmr</i>);
and thus, as Odin’s golden helmet is the beaming sky, and
as the dwarfs cover themselves with a helmet of fog, so
Æger wears on his brow a helmet made of dense darkness
and heaven-reaching, terrifying breakers.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Æger and his family, it is certain, did not belong
among the asas, yet they were regarded, like them, as
mighty beings, whose friendship was sought by the gods
themselves; and England, that proud mistress of the
sea, is the reflection of the myth of Æger, showing what
grand results are achieved historically, when human enterprise
and heroism enter into friendly relations with
the sea, making it serve the advancement of civilization,—when
the gods go to Æger’s hall to banquet.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. FREY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Njord had two children—a son Frey and a daughter
Freyju, both fair and mighty. Frey is one of the most
celebrated of the gods. He presides over rain and sunshine
and all the fruits of the earth, and should be invoked
to obtain good harvests, and also for peace. He
moreover dispenses wealth among men. He is called
van and vanagod, yeargod and goods-giver (<i>fégjafi</i>). He
owns the ship Skidbladner and also Goldenbristle (<i>gullinbursti</i>)
or Slidrugtanne (the sharp-toothed), a boar
with golden bristles, with which he rides as folk-ruler to
Odin’s hall. In time’s morning, when he was yet a child,
the gods gave him Alfheim (home of elves) as a present.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of Frey’s ship Skidbladner, we have before seen (see
p. 220) how it was made by the dwarfs, sons of Ivald,
and presented to Frey. It was so large that all the gods
with their weapons and war stores could find room on
board it. As soon as the sails are set a favorable breeze
arises and carries it to its place of destination, and it
is made of so many pieces, and with so much skill, that
when it is not wanted for a voyage Frey may fold it
together like a piece of cloth and put it into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Njord had the consolation, when he was sent as
hostage to the gods, that he begat a son whom no one
hates, but who is the best among the gods. Thus the
Elder Edda, in Æger’s banquet to the gods, where Loke
also was present:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>For I was from a far-off place</div>
      <div class='line'>Sent as a hostage to the gods—</div>
      <div class='line'>That I begat that son</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom no one hates,</div>
      <div class='line'>And who is regarded</div>
      <div class='line'>Chief among the gods.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To which <span class='sc'>Loke</span> makes reply:</p>

<p class='c009'>Frey has a servant by name <span class='sc'>Bygver</span>, who responds
to Loke:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Know that, were I born</div>
      <div class='line'>Of so noble a race</div>

      <div class='line'>And had I</div>
      <div class='line'>So glorious a hall,</div>
      <div class='line'>I would crush the evil crow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Break his bones to the marrow!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='sc'>Loke</span> then turns upon Bygver, and calls him a
little impertinent thing, that always hangs about Frey’s
ears and cries under the millstone (can the reader help
thinking at this moment of Robert Burns’ famous poem,
<i>John Barleycorn?</i>); a good-for-nothing fellow, who never
would divide good with men, and when the heroes
fought they could not find him, for he was concealed
in the straw of the bed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frey’s maid-servant is Beyla, Bygver’s wife, whom
Loke calls the ugliest and filthiest hag that can be
found among the offspring of the gods. Of course Loke
exaggerates and uses abusive language, but it was in
truth a sorry thing for Frey that he traded his sword
away, for it is to this fact he owes his defeat when he
encounters Surt in Ragnarok.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frey’s wife was Gerd, a daughter of Gymer, and
their son was Fjolner. Frey was worshiped throughout
the northern countries. In the common formula of the
oath his name was put first: <span class='sc'>Hjálpi mér svá Freyr
ok Njörðr ok hinn almáttki ás!</span> that is, So help
me Frey and Njord and the almighty Asa (Odin). On
Jul-eve (Christmas eve) it was customary to lead out a
boar, which was consecrated to Frey, and which was
called the atonement boar. On this the persons present
laid their hands and made solemn vows; and at the
feast, where the flesh of the sacrificed animal was eaten
by the assembled guests, there was drunk, among other
horns, a horn to Njord and Frey for prosperous seasons
and for peace.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>Everything about Frey goes to show that he is the
god of the earth’s fruitfulness. The sea, Njord, rises
as vapor and descends in rain upon the land, making
it fruitful. There has been much dispute about the
etymological meaning of the word Frey. Finn Magnússon
derives it from <i>frœ</i>, Norse <i>frö</i>, meaning seed.
Grimm, on the other hand, thinks the fundamental idea
is mildness, gladness (compare German <i>froh</i>, Norse
<i>fryd</i>). A derived meaning of the word is man, masculine
of Freyja (German <i>frau</i>), meaning woman.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='4'>IV</abbr>. FREY AND GERD.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Frey had one day placed himself in Hlidskjalf, and
looked out upon all the worlds. He also saw Jotunheim,
and perceived a large and stately mansion which a maid
was going to enter, and as she raised the latch of the
door so great a radiancy was thrown from her hand,
that the air and waters and all worlds were illuminated
by it. It was Gerd, a daughter of the giant Gymer
and Aurboda, relatives of Thjasse. At this sight Frey,
as a just punishment for his audacity in mounting on
that sacred throne, was struck with sudden sadness, so
that on his return home he could neither speak nor
sleep nor drink, nor did any one dare to inquire the
cause of his affliction. Frey’s messenger was named
Skirner. Njord sent for him and requested of him, as
did also Skade, that he should ask Frey why he thus
refused to speak to any one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus the Elder Edda, in the lay of Skirner:</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'>Frey, having thus given away his sword, found himself
without arms when he on another occasion fought
with Bele, and hence it was that he slew him with a
stag’s antlers. This combat was, however, a trifling
affair, for Frey could have killed him with a blow of
his fist, had he felt inclined; but the time will come
when the sons of Muspel will sally forth to the fight in
Ragnarok, and then indeed will Frey truly regret having
parted with his falchion. Having obtained the horse
and sword, Skirner set out on his journey, and thus
he addressed his horse:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Skirner rode into Jotunheim, to the court of Gymer.
Furious dogs were tied there before the gate of the
wooden inclosure which surrounded Gerd’s bower. He
rode toward a shepherd, who was sitting on a mound,
and thus addressed him:</p>

<p class='c009'>This poem illustrates how beautifully a myth can be
elaborated. Gerd is the seed; Skirner is the air that
comes with the sunshine. Thus the myth is easily explained:
The earth, in which the seed is sown, resists
the embrace of Frey; his messenger Skirner, who brings
the seed out into the light, in vain promises her the
golden ears of harvest and the ring, the symbol of
abundance. She has her giant nature, which has not
yet been touched by the divine spirit; she realizes not
the glory which she can attain to by Frey’s love. Skirner
must conjure her, he must use incantations, he
must show her how she, if not embraced by Frey, must
forever be the bride of the cold frost, and never experience
the joys of wedded life. She finally surrenders
herself to Frey, and they embrace each other, when the
buds burst forth in the grove. This myth then corresponds
to Persephone, the goddess of the grain planted
in the ground. Demeter’s sorrow on account of the
naked, forsaken field, from which the sprout shall
shoot forth from the hidden reed, is Frey’s impatient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>longing; and Skirner is Mercurius, who brings Proserpina
up from the lower world.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the myth has also a deeper ethical signification.
Our forefathers were not satisfied with the mere shell;
and Frey’s love to Gerd, which is described so vividly
in the Elder Edda, is taken from the nature of love,
with all its longings and hopes, and is not only a
symbol of what takes place in visible nature. As the
warmth of the sun develops the seed, thus love develops
the heart; love is the ray of light (Skirner) sent
from heaven, which animates and ennobles the clump
of earth. Gerd is the maid, who is engaged in earthly
affairs and does not yet realize anything nobler than
her every-day cares. Then love calls her; in her breast
awakens a new life; wonderful dreams like gentle breezes
embrace her, and when the dreams grow into consciousness
her eyes are opened to a higher sphere of existence.
This myth is most perfectly reflected in the love-story
of Fridthjof’s Saga, an old Norse romance moulded
into a most fascinating Epic Poem by Tegner. A good
English translation of this poem appeared a few years
ago in London, and was republished in this country
under the auspices of Bayard Taylor. It is also translated
into almost every other European language, and
is justly considered one of the finest poetical productions
of this century.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='5'>V</abbr>. WORSHIP OF FREY.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Sagas tell us, as has already been stated, that
Frey was worshiped extensively throughout the northern
countries.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Throndhjem there was during the reign of Olaf
Tryggvesson a temple in which Frey was zealously worshiped.
When the king, having overthrown the statue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>of the god, blamed the bondes for their stupid idolatry,
and asked them wherein Frey had evinced his power,
they answered: Frey often talked with us, foretold us
the future, and granted us good seasons and peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Norse chieftain Ingemund Thorstenson, who in
the days of the tyrant Harald Hairfair emigrated from
Norway and settled in Vatnsdal, Iceland, built near his
homestead a temple, which appears to have been specially
dedicated to Frey, who had in a manner pointed out a
dwelling-place to him; for in digging a place for his
pillars of the high-seat (<i>öndvegis-súlur</i>, something similar
to the Greek Hermes and Roman Penates), Ingemund
found in the earth an image of Frey, which he
had lost in Norway.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Icelander Thorgrim of Seabol was a zealous
worshiper of Frey, and conducted sacrificial festivals in
his honor during the winter nights. He was killed in
his bed by Gisle, and a famous funeral service was
given him; but one thing, says the Saga of Gisle Surson,
also happened, which seemed remarkable. Snow never
settled on Thorgrim’s how (grave-mound) on the south
side, nor did it freeze; it was thought that Frey loved
him so much, because he had sacrificed to him, that
he did not want it to grow cold between them.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the vicinity of the estate Tver-aa, in Eyjafjord in
Iceland, there was a temple dedicated to Frey, and the
place became so holy that no guilty person dared to
tarry there, for Frey did not allow it. When the chieftain
Thorkel the Tall was banished from Tver-aa by
Glum Eyjolfson, who is universally known as Vigaglum,
he led a full-grown ox to Frey’s temple before he left,
and thus addressed the god: Long have you been to
me a faithful friend, O Frey! Many gifts have you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>received from me and rewarded me well for them. Now
I give you this ox, in order that Glum may some day
have to leave Tver-aa no less reluctantly than I do.
And now give to me a sign to show whether you accept
this offering or not. At that moment the ox bellowed
loudly and fell dead upon the ground. Thorkel considered
this a good omen, and moved away with a lighter
heart. Afterwards (it is related in Vigaglum’s Saga) Glum
in his old days became involved in a dangerous suit for
manslaughter, which ended in his having to relinquish
Tver-aa to Ketil, son of Thorvald Krok, whom he confessed
having killed. On the night before he rode to
the <i>thing</i> (assembly, court), where his case was to be
decided, he dreamed that there had congregated a number
of men at Tver-aa to meet Frey; he saw many
down by the river (<i>á</i> is river in Icelandic), and there
sat Frey on a bench. Glum asked who they were, and
they answered: We are your departed relatives, and
have come to pray Frey that you may not be driven
from Tver-aa; but it avails us nothing. Frey answers
us short and angrily and now remembers the ox which
Thorkel the Tall gave to him. Glum awoke, and from
that time he said that he was on unfriendly terms with
Frey.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the temple at Upsala, in Sweden, Frey, together
with Odin and Thor, was especially worshiped; and by
the story of the Norseman Gunnar Helming, who in
Sweden gave himself out as Frey, it is attested that the
people in some provinces of Sweden put their highest
trust in this god, and even believed him sometimes to
appear in human form.</p>

<p class='c004'>The horse, it appears, was regarded as a favorite
animal of Frey. At his temple in Throndhjem it is said
there were horses belonging to him. It is related of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Icelander Rafnkel that he loved Frey above all other gods,
and bestowed upon him an equal share in all his best
possessions. He had a brown horse called Frey-fax (compare
Col-fax, Fair-fax, etc.), which he loved so highly
that he made a solemn vow to kill the man who should
ride this horse against his will, a vow he also
fulfilled. Another Icelander, Brand, also had a horse
called Frey-fax, which he made so much of that he was
said to believe in it as in a divinity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Frey’s boar, Gullinburste, has been referred to in connection
with the Jul or Christmas festivities, and there
are found many examples of swine-sacrifice in the old
Norse writings. King Hedrek made solemn vows on
the atonement-boar on Jul-eve, and in one of the prose
supplements to the ancient Edda poem of Helge Hjorvardson
we find that the atonement-boar is mentioned
as being led out on Jul-eve, in order that they might
lay lands upon it and make solemn vows.</p>

<p class='c004'>A highly valued wooden statue or image of Frey was
found in a temple at Throndhjem, which king Olaf
Tryggvesson hewed in pieces in the presence of the
people. Kjotve the Rich, king of Agder in Norway,
one of the chiefs who fought against Harald Fairhair,
had a weight upon which the god Frey was sculptured
in silver. This treasure, which he held in great veneration,
fell after the battle into the hands of King Harald,
and he presented it to his friend, the chieftain Ingemund
Thorstenson, who afterwards carried the image in a purse
and held it in very high esteem. This last-mentioned
image was probably borne as an amulet, as was often the
case, no doubt, with the gold braeteates which are found
in the grave-hows and in the earth, having upon them
the images of men and animals, and which are furnished
with a clasp for fastening to a necklace.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>
  <h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='6'>VI</abbr>. FREYJA.</h4>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The goddess of love is Freyja, also called Vanadis or
Vanabride. She is the daughter of Njord and the sister
of Frey. She ranks next to Frigg. She is very fond
of love ditties, and all lovers would do well to invoke
her. It is from her name that women of birth and
fortune are called in the Icelandic language <i>hús freyjur</i>
(compare Norse <i>fru</i> and German <i>frau</i>). Her abode in
heaven is called Folkvang, where she disposes of the
hall-seats. To whatever field of battle she rides she
asserts her right to one half the slain, the other half
belonging to Odin. Thus the Elder Edda, in Grimner’s
lay:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Folkvang ’tis called</div>
      <div class='line'>Where Freyja has right</div>
      <div class='line'>To dispose of the hall-seats.</div>
      <div class='line'>Every day of the slain</div>
      <div class='line'>She chooses the half</div>
      <div class='line'>And leaves half to Odin.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Her mansion, Sessrymner (having many or large
seats), is large and magnificent; thence she rides out
in a car drawn by two cats. She lends a favorable ear
to those who sue for her assistance. She possesses a
necklace called Brisingamen, or Brising. She married
a person called Oder, and their daughter, named Hnos,
is so very handsome that whatever is beautiful and
precious is called by her name <i>hnossir</i> (that means,
nice things). It is also said that she had two daughters,
Hnos and Gerseme, the latter name meaning precious.
But Oder left his wife in order to travel into very
remote countries. Since that time Freyja continually
weeps, and her tears are drops of pure gold; hence she
is also called the fair-weeping goddess (<i>it grátfagra goð</i>).
In poetry, gold is called Freyja’s tears, the rain of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Freyja’s brows or cheeks. She has a great variety of
names, for, having gone over many countries in search
of her husband, each people gave her a different name.
She is thus called Mardal, Horn, Gefn, Syr, Skjalf and
Thrung. It will also be remembered, from the chapter
about Thor, that Freyja had a falcon-guise, and how
the giant Thrym longed to possess her. In the lay of
Hyndla, in the Elder Edda, Freyja comes to her friend
and sister, the giantess Hyndla, and requests her to
ride to Valhal, to ask for success for her favorite Ottar;
promising the giantess to appease Odin and Thor, who
of course were enemies to the giants. Hyndla is inclined
to doubt Freyja’s remarks, especially as she comes
to her with Ottar in the night. Who this Ottar was
we do not know, excepting that he was a son of the
Norse hero, Instein, and hence probably a Norseman.
He was heir to an estate, but his right to it was disputed
by Angantyr. It was therefore necessary to make
his title good, and to enumerate his ancestors, but for
this he was too ignorant. Meanwhile he had always
been a devout worshiper of the asynjes (goddesses), and
had especially worshiped Freyja by making sacrifices,
images, and erecting altars to her. Hence it is that
she wishes to help him in this important case, but finds
that she is not able, and it was for this reason she
saddled her golden boar and went to the wise giantess
Hyndla, who was well posted in regard to the pedigrees,
origin and fates of gods, giants and men. Hyndla
consents to giving the information asked for, and so
she enumerates first the immediate ancestors of Ottar
on his father’s and mother’s side, then speaks of the
king so famous in olden times, Halfdan Gamle, the
original progenitor of the Skjolds and several other
noble families of the North. And as these royal families
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>were said to be descended from the gods and the
latter again from the giants, Hyndla gives some of their
genealogies also. Thus she gets an opportunity to speak
of Heimdal and his giant mothers, then of Loke and
of the monsters descended from him, which shall play
so conspicuous a part in Ragnarok, then of the mighty
god of thunder, and finally of a god yet more mighty,
whom she ventures not to name, and here she ends
her tale. She will not prophesy further than to where
Odin is swallowed by the Fenris-wolf and the world by
the yawning abyss. Freyja after this asks her for a
drink of remembrance to give to Ottar, her guest and
favorite, in order that he might be able to remember
the whole talk and the pedigree two days afterwards,
when the case between him and Angantyr should be
decided by proofs of this kind. Hyndla refuses to do
this, and upbraids her with abusive language. By this
Freyja is excited to wrath and threatens to kindle a
fire around the giantess, from which she would not be
able to escape, if she did not comply with her request.
When the threat begins to be carried out (at the breaking
forth of the flaming aurora in the morning) Hyndla
gives the requested drink, but at the same time curses it.
Freyja is not terrified by this, but removes the curse by
her blessing and earnest prayers to all divinities for the
success of her beloved Ottar.</p>

<p class='c004'>We should like to give the lay in full, as it is found
in the Elder Edda, but having quoted several strophes
from it before, and it being quite long, we reluctantly
omit it. We advise our readers, however, by all means
to read the <span class='sc'>Elder Edda</span>. There is more profound
thought in it than in any other human work, not even
Shakespeare excepted. What a pity that it is so little
known!</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>Women came after death to Freyja. When Egil
Skallagrimson had lost his young son, and was despairing
unto death on this account, his daughter Thorgerd,
who was married to Olaf in Lax-aa-dal, comes to console
him; and when she hears that he will neither eat nor
drink, then she also says that she has not and will not
eat or drink before she comes to Freyja. With <i>her</i>,
lovers who have been faithful unto death are gathered;
therefore Hagbard sings: Love is renewed in Freyja’s
halls.</p>

<p class='c004'>Freyja is the goddess of love between man and woman.
Hence we find in her nature, beauty, grace, modesty, the
longings, joys, and tears of love, and we find also that
burning love in the heart which breaks out in wild
flames. She rules in <i>Folk</i>vang, in the human dwellings,
where there are seats enough for all. No one escapes her
influence. Odin shares the slain equally with her, for the
hero has <i>two</i> grand objects in view—to conquer his enemy
and to win the heart of the maiden.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus the Norse mythology teaches us that the sturdy
Norseman was not insusceptible to impressions from
beauty nor unmoved by love. The most beautiful flowers
were named after Freyja’s hair and eye-dew, and even
animate objects, which, like the flowers, were remarkable
for their beauty, were named after this goddess, as for
instance the butterfly (Icel. <i>Freyjuhœna</i>—Freyja’s hen).</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a semi-mythological Saga called Orvarodd’s
Saga. Orvarodd signifies Arrow-odd; and as this same
Arrow-odd is implicated in a large number of love
exploits, it has been suggested that he may be Freyja’s
husband, whose name the reader remembers was Oder, the
stem of which is <i>od</i>, and hence we have in the North also
not only a <i>goddess</i> of love, but also a god of love (Cupid),
with his arrows!</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>Freyja’s cats symbolize sly fondling and sensual enjoyment.
The name of her husband, Oder, means sense,
understanding, but also wild desire. The various names
bestowed upon Freyja when she travels among the different
nations denote the various modes by which love
reveals itself in human life. The goddesses Sjofn, Lofn,
and Var, heretofore mentioned, were regarded as messengers
and attendants of Freyja. Friday (<i>dies Veneris</i>) is
named after her. (See page <a href='#Page_237'>237</a>.)</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='7'>VII</abbr>.  A BRIEF REVIEW.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The lives and exploits of the propitious divinities
have now been presented; and in presenting the myths
we have not only given the forces and phenomena
of nature symbolized by the myths, but we have also
tried to bring the mythology down from heaven to the
earth, and exhibit the value it had in the minds of our
ancestors. We have tried, as Socrates did with his
philosophy, to show what influence the myths have had
upon the life of our forefathers; in other words, we have
tried to put a kernel into the shell. We have tried to
present the mythology, not as the science and laws by
which the universe is governed, but as something—call
it science or what you will—by which to illustrate how
the contemplation of the forces and phenomena of nature
have influenced human thought and action. Language
is in its origin nothing but impressions from nature,
which having been revolved for a time in the human
mind find their expression in words. Poetry is in its
origin nothing else but expressions of human thought
and feeling called forth by the contemplation of the
wonderful works of God. And this is also true of
mythology.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>We have found the propitious divinities divided into
three classes, those of heaven, those of earth, and those
of the sea. The union or marriage between heaven and
earth has been promoted in various myths. The king
of heaven is but <i>one</i>, but he embraces the earth in various
forms, and the earth is, in a new form, wedded to
the god of thunder; nay, the vans, or divinities of the
sea, arise and fill the land with blessings in various ways.
The manner in which the gods are combined and interlinked
with each other in one grand system is a feature
peculiar to the Norse mythology. There is not, as in
the Greek, a series of separate groups and separate dwellings,
but the gods come in frequent contact with each
other. Odin rules in the heavens, Thor in the clouds,
Heimdal in the rainbow, Balder in the realms of light,
Frey with his elves of light in the earth, but the sun
affects them all: it is Odin’s eye, it is Balder’s countenance,
Heimdal needs it for his rainbow, and Frey governs
its rays; and still the sun itself rides as a beaming maid
with her horses from morning until evening. The earth
has its various forms, and the seed planted in the earth
has its own god (Frey), surrounded by the spirits of the
groves, the forests and the fountains. And the king of
heaven unites man with nature; he not only provides
for his animal life, but also breathes into him a living
soul and inspires him with enthusiasm. He sits with
Saga at the fountain of history; he sends out his son
Brage, the god of poetry and eloquence, and unites him
with Idun, the rejuvenating goddess, whose carefully
protected rivers meander through the grove full of fruit
trees bearing golden apples; and he lets his other son,
Balder, the ruler of light, marry the industrious flower-goddess,
Nanna, who with her maids spreads a fragrant
carpet over the earth. And as the god of thunder rules
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>but to protect heaven and earth, so the naked desert
and the impenetrable forest exist only to remind us of
the incorruptible vital force of nature, safe against all
attacks. The imperishableness of nature appears more
strikingly in the stupendous mountains and gigantic
forests than in the fertile, cultivated and protected parts
of the earth. Now let us again ask: Is there nothing
here for the poet or artist? Has the Norse mythology
nothing that can be elaborated and clothed with beautiful
forms and colors? Does this mythology not contain
germs that art can develop into fragrant leaves,
swelling buds and radiant blossoms? Does not this
our Gothic inheritance deserve a place with the handmaids
of literature? Will not our poets, public speakers,
lecturers, essayists, and writers of elegant literature
generally, who make so many quaint allusions to, and
borrow so many elegant and suggestive illustrations
from, Greek mythology; will they not, we say, do
their own ancestors the honor to dip their pen occasionally
into the mythology of the Gothic race? It is
bad practice to borrow when we can get along without
it, besides the products of the south thrive not well in
our northern Gothic soil and climate. Ygdrasil grows
better here, and that is a tree large enough and fruitful
enough to sustain the Gothic race with enthusiasm and
inspiration for centuries yet to come, and to supply a
a whole race of future bards and poets and artists with a
precious and animating elixir. Our next generation
will comprehend this.</p>

  <h3 id='chap2-7' class='c007'>CHAPTER <abbr title='7'>VII</abbr>. <br /> THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVIL. LOKE AND HIS OFFSPRING.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='1'>I</abbr>. LOKE.</h4>
<p class='c006'>We have now made an acquaintance with the lives
and exploits or the good and propitious divinities,
with the asas and vans. But what of the evil?
Whence come they, and how have they been developed?
Many a philosopher has puzzled his brain with this vexed
question, and the wisest minds are still engaged in deep
meditations in regard to it. It is and will remain an
unsolved problem. But what did the old Goths, and
particularly our Norse forefathers, think about the
development of evil? What forms did it assume among
them? How did it spring forth in nature, and how did
it impress the minds and hearts of the people? These
are questions now to be answered.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are in the Norse mythology two individuals
by the name of Loke. The one is <i>Utgard</i>-Loke, hideous
in his whole being, and his character was sketched in
the myth about Thor and Skrymer (see <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> <a href='#Page_312'>312</a>-322); he
represents physical and moral evil in all its naked loathsomeness.
The other is <i>Asa</i>-Loke, of whom there also
have been accounts given at various times in connection
with the propitious gods; and it is of him solely we are
now to speak, as the former belongs wholly to the race
of giants. Asa-Loke, whom we shall hereafter call by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>common name, Loke, is the same evil principle in all its
various manifestations; but as he makes his appearance
among the gods, he represents evil in the seductive and
seemingly beautiful form in which it glides about through
the world. We find him flowing in the veins of the
human race and call him sin, or passion. In nature he
is the corrupting element in air, fire and water. In the
bowels of the earth he is the volcanic flame, in the sea
he appears as a fierce serpent, and in the lower world
we recognize him as pale death. Thus, like Odin, Loke
pervades all nature. And in no divinity is it more clear
than in this, that the idea proceeding from the visible
workings of nature entered the human heart and mind
and there found its moral or ethical reflection. Loke
symbolises sin, shrewdness, deceitfulness, treachery, malice,
etc. Loke is indeed in his development one of the
profoundest myths. In the beginning he was intimately
connected with Odin, then he became united with the air,
and finally he impersonates the destructive fire. And in
these changes he keeps growing worse and worse.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the banquet of Æger he reminds Odin that they
in the beginning of time had their blood mixed. Thus
the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>LOKE:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Do thou mind, Odin,</div>
      <div class='line'>That we in time’s morning</div>
      <div class='line'>Mixed blood together!</div>
      <div class='line'>Then thou pretendedst</div>
      <div class='line'>That thou never wouldst ask a drink</div>
      <div class='line'>Unless it was offered to both of us.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sameness of blood symbolizes sameness of mind, and
Loke is in the Younger Edda called Odin’s brother, the
uncle of the gods. Under the name of Loder, or Lopter,
Loke took part in the creation of man; he gave the
senses, the sources of evil desires, the passions, the fire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>of the veins. Thus he is like the fire, which is beneficent
and necessary for development, but also dangerous
and destructive. With the giantess Angerboda (producing
sorrow) he begat the wolf Fenrer, but the most
disgusting monster is the woman Hel, who is a daughter
of Loke. <i>Odin</i> unites himself with the gigantic force
in nature, but he does this to develop, ennoble and
elevate it. <i>Loke</i> unites himself with crude matter, but
by this union he only still further develops the evil
principle, which then expresses itself in all kinds of
terrible phenomena: the sea tosses its waves against
heaven itself, and rushes out upon the land; the air
trembles; then comes snow and howling winds; the rain
splashes down upon the earth, etc. Such is also his
influence upon the human mind. He is the sly, treacherous
father of lies. In appearance he is beautiful and
fair, but in his mind he is evil, and in his inclinations
he is inconstant. Notwithstanding his being ranked
among the gods, he is the slanderer of the gods, the
grand contriver of deceit and fraud, the reproach of
gods and men. Nobody renders him divine honors.
He surpasses all mortals in the arts of perfidy and
craft.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is some dispute about the real meaning of
Loke’s name. Some derive it from the Icelandic <i>lúka</i>,
to end, thus arguing that Loke is the end and consummation
of divinity. Another definition is given, taken
from the Icelandic <i>logi</i> (Anglo-Saxon <i>lîg</i>), according to
which the primary meaning would be fire, flame. He
is also called Loder, or Lopter (the aërial; compare
Norse <i>luft</i>, Anglo-Saxon <i>lyft</i>, air); and this would seem
to corroborate the definition of Loke as fire. Loder
(<i>lodern</i>, to blaze) would then designate him in the character
of the blazing earthly fire, and Lopter as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>heated and unsteady air. He is son of the giant Farbaute,
that is, the one who strikes the ships, the wind.
His mother is Laufey, or Nal, the former meaning leaf-isle,
and the latter needle. Oak trees produce leaves and
pines produce needles; both Laufey and Nal are therefore
combustibles. His brothers are Byleist (dwelling
destroyer, raging flame), and Helblinde, the latter being
another name for Odin.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the previous chapters it has frequently been seen
how Loke time and again accompanied the gods, they
making use of his strength and cunning; but it has
also been shown how he acted in concert with the
jotuns and exposed the gods to very great perils and
then extricated them again by his artifices. By Loke’s
advice the gods engage the artificer to build a dwelling
so well fortified that they should be perfectly safe from
the incursions of the frost-giants. For this the artificer
is to receive Freyja, providing he completes his work
within a stipulated time; but Loke prevented him from
completing his task by the birth of Sleipner. When the
dwarfs forge the precious things for the gods, it is he
who brings about that the work lacks perfection, and
even the handle of Thor’s mallet, Mjolner, becomes too
short; for evil is everywhere present and makes the best
things defective. He cuts the hair of the goddess Sif, and
by this he makes way for the forging of the precious articles;
thus evil often in spite of itself produces good
results. Examples of this abound in the history of the
world. Loke gives Thjasse an opportunity to rob Idun,
but brings her back again and thus causes Thjasse’s
death. He hungers at Geirrod’s, and causes Thor to
undertake his dangerous journey; but he also looks after
Thor’s hammer, and accompanies him as maid-servant to
get it back. He steals Freyja’s Brisingamen, and quarrels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>with Heimdal about it. But his worst deed is Balder’s
death. For these reasons Loke is in Old Norse
poetry called: son of Farbaute, son of Laufey, son of Nal,
brother of Byleist, brother of Helblinde, father of the
Fenris-wolf, father of the Midgard-serpent, father of Hel,
uncle of Odin, visitor and chest-goods of Geirrod, thief of
Brisingamen and of Idun’s apples, defender of Sigyn (his
wife), Sif’s hair destroyer, adviser of Balder’s bane, etc.</p>

<p class='c004'>Odin, Hœner and Loke are often together. It is related
that they once set out to explore the whole world.
They came to a stream, and followed it until they came
to a force (cascade) where there sat an otter near the
force. It had caught a salmon in the force and sat
half sleeping eating it. Then Loke picked up a stone
and threw it at the otter, struck it in the head and then
boasted of his deed, for he had killed or captured both
the otter and salmon with one stone. They then took
the salmon and otter with them and came to a gard
(farm), where they entered the house. The bonde,<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
who lived there, hight Hreidmar, an able fellow well
skilled in necromancy. The gods asked for night lodgings,
but added that they were supplied with provisions
whereupon they showed what they had caught.
But when Hreidmar saw the otter he called to him his
sons Fafner and Regin, and told them that their brother
Odder (otter) Wad been slain, and who had done it.
Father and sons then attack the gods, overpower and
bind them, and then inform them that the otter was
Hreidmar’s son. The gods offered a ransom for their
lives, as large as Hreidmar himself would determine it;
they made a treaty accordingly, confirming it with oaths.
When the otter then had been flayed, Hreidmar took
the skin and demanded that they should fill it with
shining gold and then perfectly cover it with the same.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>These were the terms of agreement. Then Odin sent
Loke to the home of the swarthy elves (Svartalf-heim),
where he met the dwarf Andvare (wary, cautious spirit),
who lived as a fish, in the water. Loke borrowed Ran’s
net and caught him, and demanded of him, as a ransom
for his life, all the gold he had in the rock, where
he dwelt. And when they came into the rock the dwarf
produced all the gold which he possessed, which was a
considerable amount; but Loke observed that the dwarf
concealed under his arm a gold ring, and ordered him
to give it up. The dwarf prayed Loke by all means to
let him keep it; for when he kept this ring, he said,
he could produce for himself more of the metal from
it. But Loke said that he should not keep so much as
a penny, and took the ring from him, and went out.
Then said the dwarf, that that ring should be the
bane of the person who possessed it. Loke had no
objection to this, and said that, in order that this purpose
should be kept, he should bring these words to the
knowledge of him who should possess it. Then Loke
returned to Hreidmar, and showed Odin the gold; but
when the latter saw the ring he thought it was pretty;
he therefore, taking it, gave Hreidmar the rest of the
gold. Hreidmar then filled the otter-skin as well as he
could, and set it down when it was full. Then Odin went
to cover the bag with gold, and afterwards bade Hreidmar
whether the bag was perfectly covered; but
Hreidmar examined, and looked carefully in every place,
and found an uncovered hair near the mouth, which
Odin would have to cover, or the agreement would be
broken. Then Odin produced the ring and covered the
hair with it, and said that they now had paid the otter-ransom.
But when Odin had taken his spear, and Loke
his shoes, so that they had nothing more to fear, Loke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>said that the curse of the dwarf Andvare should be fulfilled,
and that this gold and this ring should be the
bane of him who possessed it. From this myth it is
that gold is poetically called otter-ransom.</p>

<p class='c004'>And the curse was fulfilled. This curse of ill-gotten
gold became the root of a series of mortal calamities,
which are related in the latter part of the Elder Edda,
in the songs about Sigurd Fafner’s bane, or the Slayer
of Fafner; about Brynhild, about Gudrun’s sorrow,
Gudrun’s revenge, in the song about Atle, etc. The
curse on the gold, pronounced upon it by Andvare, the
dwarf, is the grand moral in these wonderful songs,
and never was moral worked out more terribly. Even
Shakespeare has no tragedy equal to it. When Odin
and Loke had gone away, Fafner and Regin demanded
from their father, Hreidmar, a share of the ransom in
the name of their brother Odder; but Hreidmar refused,
so Fafner pierced his father with a sword while he
slept. Thus Hreidmar died, but Fafner took all the
gold. Then Regin demanded his paternal inheritance,
but Fafner refused to give it, and disappeared. Another
prominent character in the Edda is Sigurd, who frequently
visited Regin and told him that Fafner, having
assumed the shape of a monstrous dragon, lay on Gnita
Heath, and had Æger’s helmet, the helmet of terror,
before which all living trembled. Regin made a sword
for Sigurd, which was called Gram; it was so sharp that
when it stood in the river and a tuft of wool floated on
the current, the sword would cut the wool as easily as
the water. With this sword Sigurd cut Regin’s anvil in
twain. Regin excites Sigurd to kill Fafner, and accordingly
Sigurd and Regin proceeded on their way to Gnita
Heath, and discovered Fafner’s path, whereupon the latter
(Fafner) crept into the water. In the way Sigurd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>dug a large grave and went down into it. When Fafner
now crept away from the gold he spit poison, but this
flew over Sigurd’s head, and as Fafner passed over the
grave Sigurd pierced him with his sword to the heart.
Fafner trembled convulsively, and fiercely shook his
head and tail. Sigurd sprang out of the grave when
they saw each other. Then a conversation takes place
between them, in which Fafner heaps curses upon Sigurd
until the former expires. Regin had gone away while
Sigurd killed Fafner, but came back while Sigurd was
wiping the blood off the sword.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sigurd took Fafner’s heart, put it on a spit and
roasted it; but when he thought it must be roasted
enough, and when the juice oozed out of the heart, he
felt of it with his fingers to see whether it was well done.
He burned himself, and put his finger into his mouth, but
when the blood of Fafner’s heart touched his tongue he
understood the song of birds. He heard birds singing in
the bushes, and seven birds sang a strophe each, talking
about how Regin might avenge his brother, kill Sigurd,
and possess the treasure alone, when Sigurd finally says:</p>

<p class='c009'>And he cut the head off Regin, ate afterwards Fafner’s

      <div class='line'>Sigurd! gather</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>Sigurd followed the track of the dragon to his nest
and found it open. Its doors and door-frames, and all
the beams and posts of the place, were of iron, but the
treasure was buried in the ground. There Sigurd found
a large heap of gold, with which he filled two chests.
Then he took the helmet of terror (Æger’s helmet), a
gold cuirass, the sword Hrotte, and many treasures,
which he put on the back of the horse Grane, but the
horse would not proceed before Sigurd mounted it also.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is but the beginning of this terrible tragedy, but
our space does not allow us here to enter upon all the
fatal results of the curse of Andvare. In the fate, first
of Sigurd and Brynhild, and afterwards of Sigurd and
Gudrun, is depicted passion, tenderness and sorrow with
a vivid power which nowhere has a superior. The men
are princely warriors and the women are not only fair,
but godlike, in their beauty and vigor. The noblest
sentiments and most heroic actions are crossed by the
foulest crimes and the most terrific tragedies. In this
train of events, produced by the curse of Andvare alone,
there is material for a score of dramas of the most absorbing
character. In the story of Sigurd and Brynhild, as
we find it in the latter part of the Elder Edda, there are
themes for tragic and heroic composition that would
become as immortal as Dante’s <i>Inferno</i> or Shakespeare’s
<i>Macbeth</i>, for they are based on our profoundest sympathies,
and appeal most forcibly to our ideas of the beautiful
and the true.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ring Andvarenant (Andvare’s gift), as it is called,
here as elsewhere, symbolizes wealth, which increases in
the hands of the wary, careful Andvare (<i>and-vari</i>, wary).
But for avarice, that never gets enough, it becomes a
destructive curse. It is perfectly in harmony with Loke’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>character to be satisfied and pleased with the curse
attached to the ring.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='2'>II</abbr>. LOKE’S CHILDREN. THE FENRIS-WOLF.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Loke’s wife was Sigyn; their son was Nare or Narfe,
and a brother of him was Ale (Ole) or Vale.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the hag, Angerboda, Loke had three children.
Angerbode was a giantess of Jotunheim, and her name
means anguish-boding. The children’s names are Fenrer
or Fenris-wolf, the Midgard-serpent called Jormungander,
and Hel. Tho gods were not long ignorant that these
monsters continued to be bred up in Jotunheim, and,
having had recourse to divination, became aware of all
the evils they would have to suffer from them; that they
were sprung from such a bad mother was a <i>bad</i> omen,
and from such a father, one still worse. Allfather (Odin)
therefore deemed it advisable to send the gods to bring
them to him. When they came, he threw the serpent
into that deep ocean by which the earth is encircled. But
the monster has grown to such an enormous size, that
holding his tail in his mouth he engirdles the whole
earth. Hel he cast headlong into Niflheim, and gave her
power over nine worlds (regions), into which she distributes
those who are sent to her,—that is to say, all who
die through sickness or old age. Here she possesses a
habitation protested by exceedingly high walls and
strongly-barred gates. Her hall is called Elvidner (place
of storm); hunger is her table; starvation, her knife;
delay, her man-servant; slowness, her maid-servant;
precipice, her threshold; care, her bed; and burning
anguish forms the hangings of her apartments. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>one half of her body is livid, the other half the color of
human flesh. She may therefore easily be recognized;
the more so as she has a dreadfully stern and grim
countenance.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wolf Fenrer was bred up among the gods, but
Tyr alone had courage enough to go and feed him.
Nevertheless, when the gods perceived that he every day
increased prodigiously in size, and that the oracles warned
then that he would one day become fatal to them, they
determined to make a very strong iron chain for him,
which they called Leding. Taking this fetter to the
wolf, they requested him to try his strength on it. Fenrer,
perceiving that the enterprise would not be very
difficult for him, let them do what they pleased, permitted
himself to be bound, and then by great muscular exertion
burst the chain and set himself at liberty. The gods
having seen this, made another chain, twice as strong
as the former, and this they called Drome. They prevailed
on the wolf to put it on, assuring him that, by
breaking this, he would give an incontestible proof of
his strength; it would be a great honor to him if so
great a chain could not hold him.</p>

<p class='c004'>The wolf saw well enough that it would not be so
easy to break this fetter, but finding at the same time
that his strength had increased since he broke Leding,
and thinking that he could never become famous without
running some risk, he voluntarily submitted to be
chained. When the gods told him that they had finished
their task, Fenrer shook himself violently, stretched his
limbs, rolled on the ground, and at last burst his chains,
which flew in pieces all around him. He thus freed
himself from Drome. From that time we have the
proverbs, to get loose out of Leding, or to dash out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>Drome, when anything is to be accomplished by powerful
efforts.</p>

<p class='c004'>After this the gods despaired of ever being able to
bind the wolf; wherefore Odin sent Skirner, the messenger
of Frey, down to the abode of the dark elves
(Svartalf-heim), to engage certain dwarfs to make the
chain called Gleipner. It was made out of six things,
namely, the noise made by the footstep of a cat, the
beard of a woman, the roots of the mountains, the
sinews of the bear, the breath of the fish, and the
spittle of birds (the enumeration of these things produces
alliteration in Icelandic). And although you, says
he who relates this in the Younger Edda, may not
have heard of these things before, you may easily convince
yourself that I have not been telling you lies.
You may have observed that woman has no beard,
that cats make no noise when they run, and that there
are no roots under the mountains; but it is a nevertheless
none the less true what I have related, although
there may be some things that you are not able to
furnish proof of.</p>

<p class='c004'>How was this chain smithied? It was perfectly
smooth and soft like a silken string, and yet, as we
shall presently see, very firm and strong. When this
fetter was brought to the gods, they were profuse in
their thanks to Skirner for the trouble he had given
himself and for having done his errand so well, and taking
the wolf with them they proceeded to a lake called
Amsvartner, to a holm (rocky island) which is called
Lyngve. They showed the string to the wolf, and expressed
their wish that he would try to break it, at the
same time assuring him that it was somewhat stronger
than its thinness would warrant a person in supposing
it to be. They took it themselves one after another in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>their hands, and, after attempting in vain to break it,
said: You alone, Fenrer are able to accomplish such a
feat. Methinks, replied the wolf, that I shall acquire
no fame by breaking such a slender thread, but if any
deceit or artifice has been employed in making it, slender
though it seems, it shall never come on my feet.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gods assured him that he would easily break a
limber silken cord, since he had already burst asunder
iron fetters of the most solid construction; but if you
should not succeed in breaking it, they added, you will
show that you are too weak to cause the gods any fear,
and we will not hesitate to set you at liberty without
delay. I fear much, replied the wolf, that if you once
bind me so fast that I shall be unable to free myself
by my own efforts, you will be in no haste to loose me.
Loath am I therefore to have this cord wound around
me, but in order that you may not doubt my courage,
I will consent, provided one of you put his hand into
my mouth, as a pledge that you intend me no deceit.
The gods looked wistfully at one another, and thought
the conditions severe, finding that they had only the
choice of two evils, and no one would sacrifice his
hand, until Tyr, as has formerly been related, stepped
forward and intrepidly put his hand between the monster’s
jaws. Thereupon the gods having tied up the
wolf, he violently stretched himself as he had formerly
done, and used all his might to disengage himself, but
the more efforts he made the tighter became the cord.
Then all the gods burst out in laughter at the sight,
excepting Tyr, who lost his hand.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the gods saw that the wolf was effectually
bound, they took the chain called Gelgja, which was
attached to the cord, and drew it through the middle
of a large rock called Gjol, which they sank deep into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>the earth; afterwards, to make it still more secure, they
fastened the end of the cord to another massive stone
called Thvite, which they sank still deeper. The wolf
made in vain the most violent efforts to break loose,
and, opening his tremendous jaws, and turning in every
possible direction, endeavored to bite the gods. They,
seeing this, thrust a sword into his mouth within his
outstretched jaws, so that the hilt stood in his lower jaw
and the point in the roof of the mouth; and this is
called his palate-spar (<i>gómsparri</i>). He howls horribly,
and the foam flows continually from his month in such
abundance that it forms the river called Von; from
which the wolf is also sometimes called Vonargander.
There he will remain until Ragnarok, the Twilight of
the gods. But why did not the gods slay the wolf, when
they have so much evil to fear from him? Because
they had so much respect for the sanctity of their
peace-steads that they would not stain them with the
blood of the wolf, although prophecies foretold to them
that he must one day become the bane of Odin.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Fenris-wolf is the earthly fire chained by man,
exceedingly ferocious when let loose, as has been terribly
illustrated by our recent fires in Chicago and her
sister city Boston; as a devouring wolf it attacks and
licks up the dwellings of men, as it is said in the lay
of Haakon:</p>

<p class='c009'>Once it shall, with its upper jaw reaching to the

<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>on the island, where a grave is dug and a furnace
is built of stone, with the draft (mouth) partially barred,
so that the fire is surrounded by things which prevent
its spreading. It is managed and controlled by men
for their advantage, and it is so useful that no one would
think of entirely destroying it (killing it).</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='3'>III</abbr>. JORMUNDGANDER, OR THE MIDGARD-SERPENT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The Midgard- or world-serpent we have already become
tolerably well acquainted with, and recognize in
him the wild tumultuous sea. Thor contended with
him; he got him on his hook, but did not succeed in
killing him. We also remember how Thor tried to lift
him in the form of a cat. The North abounds in
stories about the sea-serpent, which a nothing but
variations of the original myth of the Eddas. Odin
cast him into the sea, where he shall remain until he
is conquered by Thor in Ragnarok.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='4'>IV</abbr>. HEL.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The goddess, or giantess (it is difficult to decide what
to call her), Hel, is painted with vivid colors. She rules
over nine worlds in Niflheim, where she dwells under
one of the roots of Ygdrasil. Her home is called Helheim.
The way thither, Hel-way, is long. Hermod traveled
it in nine days and nine nights. Its course is
always downward and northward. Her dwelling is surrounded
by a fence or inclosure with one or more large
gates. Gloomy rivers flow through her world. One of
these streams is called Slid, which rises in the east and
flows westward through valleys of venom, and is full of
mud and swords. A dog stands outside of a cave (Gnipahellir).
With blood-stained breast and loud howling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>this dog came from Hel to meet Odin, when the latter
rode down to wake the vala, who lay buried in her
grave-mound east of the Hel-gate, and to inquire about
the fate of Balder. Horrible is the coming of Hel, for
she binds the dying man with strong chains that cannot
be broken. Anguish gnaws his heart, and every evening
Hel’s maids come and invite him. These maids are also
represented as dead women, who come in the night and
invite him who is dying to their benches. And to the
vision of the dying man opens a horrible, gloomy world
of fog; he sees the sun, the genuine star of day, sink
and disappear, while he, on the other hand, hears the
gate of Hel harshly grate on its hinges, opening to
receive him. Hel receives all that die of sickness or old
age. But it also seems that others, both good and evil,
come there; for Balder we know came to Hel, after he
had been slain by Hoder. And Sigurd, who we remember
slew Fafner, was afterwards assassinated by Gunnar
and went to Hel; and thither went also Brynhild, in
her beautiful car, after she had been burned on her
funeral pile. Hel’s company is large, but she has dwellings
enough for all; for her regions extend widely, and
her palaces are terribly high and have large gates. Of
course it is all shadows, but it has the appearance of
reality.</p>

<p class='c004'>For Balder,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The decorated seats</div>
      <div class='line'>Were strewn with rings;</div>
      <div class='line'>The lordly couch</div>
      <div class='line'>Was radiant with gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the pure mead</div>
      <div class='line'>Was brewed for him.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>But there seems to have been a place set aside far
down in the deepest abyss of Hel for the wicked; for
it is said that the evil went to Hel, and thence to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>Niflhel, that is, down into the ninth world. And it is
here, in this most infernal pit, that the palace is named
Anguish; the table, Famine; the waiters, Slowness and
Delay; the threshold, Precipice, and the bed, Care. It
is here Hel is so livid and ghastly pale that her very
looks inspire horror.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hel’s horse has three feet. Hel-shoes were tied on to
the feet of the dead, even though they went to Valhal.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our English word <i>hell</i> is connected with the goddess
Hel,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a> and to kill is in Norse <i>at slaa ihel</i> (i-Hel). The
faith in this goddess is not yet perfectly eradicated from
the minds of the people. Her dog is yet heard barking
outside of houses as a warning that death is near. She
wanders about from place to place as a messenger of
death. In the story of Olaf Geirstada-alf it is a large
ox, that goes from farm to farm, and at his breath
people sink down dead. In the popular mind in Norway
this messenger of death is sometimes thought to be a
three-footed goat, and at other times a white three-footed
horse. To see it is a sure sign of death. When a person
has recovered from a dangerous illness, it is said that
he has given Death a bushel of oats, for her wants must
be supplied, and Hel wandering about in the guise of a
goat, ox or horse, may accept oats as a compromise.</p>

<p class='c004'>It may also be noticed here, that the so-called Black
Plague, or Black Death, that ravaged Norway as well as
many other European countries about the middle of the
fourteenth century, assumed in the minds of the Norsemen
the form of an old hag (Thok, Hel, Loke), going
through the realm from parish to parish with a rake
and a broom. In some parishes she used the rake, and
there a few were spared; in other parishes she used the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>broom, and there all perished, and the parishes were
swept clean.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='5'>V</abbr>. THE NORSEMEN’S IDEA OF DEATH.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a></h4>
<p class='c006'>The Norse mythology shows that our ancestors had
a deeply-rooted belief in the immortality of the soul.
They believed in a state of retribution beyond the grave.
The dissolution of the body was typified by Balder’s
death, and like the latter it was result of Loke’s
malignity, just as the devil brought death upon Adam
and Eve, and through them upon all mankind.</p>

<p class='c004'>But while we find the belief in the imperishableness
of the soul firmly established, the ideas regarding the
state of existence after death were somewhat unsettled.
We are soon to present the Eddaic doctrines of future
life, but in connection with Hel it seems proper to give
some further explanation of the ideas that our forefathers
entertained of death. Hel’s gate is open, or
ajar, said the old Goths, when the shades of death went
out through the darkness of night and terrified all;
but it is also open to receive the child with rosy cheeks
as well as the man with hoary locks and trembling gait.</p>

<p class='c004'>The future state was regarded as a continuation of
our earthly existence. This is proved by the custom so
prevalent among the Norsemen of supplying the dead
with the best part of their property and the first necessities
of life. A coin was put under the dead man’s tongue,
that he might be able to defray his first expenses with
it on his way to his final abode. Of course the dead
went either to Odin or to Hel, but the relation between
Valhal and Helheim presented difficulties which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>Norsemen strove in various ways to solve. It was said
that they who are slain in battle go to Odin in Valhal,
while those who die of sickness or old age go to Hel
in Helheim. But according to this it would be the kind
of death alone which decided the soul’s future state;
only those who fell by weapons would ascend to the
glad abodes of heaven, while all who die of sickness
would have to wander away to the dark world of the
abyss, and there were people in whose eyes nothing
except warlike deeds was praiseworthy. But the Odinic
mythology, taken as a whole, presents a different view,
although it must be admitted, as has before repeatedly
been stated, that bravery was a cardinal virtue among
our Norse ancestors.</p>

<p class='c004'>We remember, from a previous chapter in this book,
that the spirit or soul of man was a gift of Odin, while
the body, blood and external beauty were a gift of
Loder, who afterwards separated from the trinity of
Odin, Hœner and Loder and became the mischievous
Loke. Thus the soul belonged to the spirit-world, or
Heaven, and the body to the material world, to the Deep.
The two, soul and body, were joined together in this
earthly life, but at its close they were separated, and each
returned to its original source. The soul, with its more
refined bodily form in which it was thought to be enveloped,
went to the home of the gods, while the body,
with the grosser material life, which was conceived to
be inseparable from it, went to the abodes of Hel to become
the prey of Loke’s daughter. Thus man’s being
was divided between Odin and Hel. Odin, whose chief
characteristic was <i>god of war</i>, seems to have claimed his
share chiefly from those who fell in battle; and this
probably may suggest to us some reason why Balder
went to Hel. Balder is not a fighting god, he only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>shines, conferring numberless blessings on mankind,
and death finally steals upon him. Odin seems not to
have much need of his like. Thus death by arms came
to be considered a happy lot, by the zealous followers
of the asa-faith, for it was a proof of Odin’s favor smiling
upon them. He who fell by arms was called by
Odin to himself, before Hel laid claim to her share of
his being; he was Odin’s chosen son, who with longing
was awaited in Valhal, that he, in the ranks of the
einherjes, might assist and sustain the gods in their last
battle, in Ragnarok. In accordance with this theory
we find in the ancient song of praise to the fallen king
Erik Blood-ax, that Sigmund asks Odin this question:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why snatch him then, father,</div>
      <div class='line'>From fortune and glory?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why not leave him rather</div>
      <div class='line'>To fill up his story</div>
      <div class='line'>On victory’s road?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
 <div class='line c014'>ODIN:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Because no man knows</div>
      <div class='line'>When gray wolf<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a> so gory</div>
      <div class='line'>His grisly maw shows</div>
      <div class='line'>In Asgard’s abode;</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore Odin calls</div>
      <div class='line'>And Erik fain falls</div>
      <div class='line'>To follow his liege lord</div>
      <div class='line'>And fight for his god.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>By this Odin means to say, we do not know when
the Fenris-wolf may come, and therefore we may need
Erik’s assistance. In the same sense the valkyrie is
made by Eyvind Skaldespiller, in Hákonarmál, to say:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now <i>are strengthened the host of the gods</i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since they have Haakon</div>
      <div class='line'>And his valiant army</div>
      <div class='line'>Home to themselves brought.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>But because the dead who were slain by arms were
thought to be called to Valhal, to unite themselves with
the hosts of the einherjes, it was not supposed that Hel
did not get her share in their being; nor was it supposed,
on the other hand, that the soul of every one who died
a natural death was shut out from heaven and forced to
follow the body down into the abodes of Hel. That it
was virtue, on the whole, and not bravery alone, which
was to be rewarded in another life, and that it was
wickedness and vice that were to be punished, is distinctly
shown in the first poem of the Elder Edda, where it
says of Gimle:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The virtuous there</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall always dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>And evermore</div>
      <div class='line'>Delights enjoy;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>while perjurers, murderers and adulterers shall wade
through thick venom-streams in Naastrand. But it
must be remembered that Gimle and Naastrand had
reference to the state of things after Ragnarok, the Twilight
of the gods; while Valhal and Hel have reference
to the state of things between death and Ragnarok,—a
time of existence corresponding somewhat to what is
called <i>purgatory</i> by the Catholic church. It may however
be fairly assumed that the ideas which our ancestors
had of reward and punishment concerning the preceding
middle state (purgatory) of the dead, were similar to those
which they had concerning the state after Ragnarok.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was certainly believed that the soul of the virtuous,
even though death by arms had not released it from the
body and raised it up to the rank of the real einherjes, still
found an abode in heaven, either in Valhal or in Vingolf
or in Folkvang. The skald, Thjodolf of Hvin, makes
King Vanlande go to Odin, although Hel tortured him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>and Egil Skallagrimson, lamenting the death of his
drowned son, knows that the son has come to the home
of the gods (Gudheimr), while of himself he says that
he fearlessly awaits the coming of Hel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of Nanna we read that she went with her husband,
Balder, to Hel; but the souls of noble women were believed
to go to heaven after death. There they found an
abode with Freyja, and the spirits of maidens with Gefjun.
When it is said that Freyja shares the slain with
Odin, it may be supposed to mean that the slain, who in
life had loved wives, were united to them again with
Freyja.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the other hand, it was as certainly believed that
blasphemy and baseness might shut out even the bravest
from Valhal. In the Saga of Burnt Njal, Hakon Jarl
says of the bold but wicked Hrap, who had seduced his
benefactor’s daughter and burned a temple: The man
who did this shall be banished from Valhal and never
come thither.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reader may think that the statements here presented
show some inconsistency in the theory and plan
of salvation according to the doctrines of the Norse
mythology. We admit that there <i>seems</i> to be some inconsistency,
but let us ask, is not this charge also frequently
made against the Scriptures? Is not the church, on this
very question of the plan of salvation, divided into two
great parties, the one insisting on faith and the other on
works? The one party quoting and requoting Paul, in
his epistle to the Romans (iii, 28), where he says, that
man is justified by <i>faith</i> without the deeds of the law;
and the other appealing to James’ epistle (ii, 24), where
he says, that by works a man is justified, and not by faith
only. And as the most eminent divines have found harmony
in the principles of the Mosaic-Christian religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>as laid down in the Scriptures, so we venture to assert
that a profound study of the Odinic mythology will
enable the student to elicit a sublime harmony in its
doctrines and principles.</p>

<p class='c004'>The strict construction of the asa-doctrine appears
to be this, that although man in the intermediate state,
between death and Ragnarok, was divided between Odin
and Hel, yet each one’s share of his being, after death,
was greater or less according to the life he had lived.
The spirit of the virtuous and the brave had the power
to bear up to heaven with it after death the better part
of its corporeal being, and Hel obtained only the dust.
But he whose spirit, by wickedness and base, sensual lust
was drawn away from heaven, became in all his being
the prey of Hel. His soul was not strong enough to
mount freely up to the celestial abodes of the gods, but
was drawn down into the abyss by the dust with which
it had ever been clogged. Perhaps the representation of
Hel as being half white and half pale-blue had its origin
in this thought, that to the good, death appeared as a
bright (white) goddess of deliverance, but to the wicked,
as a dark and punishing deity.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the drowned came to the halls of Ran, the
sea-goddess took the part of Hel; that is, Ran claimed
the body as her part, while the spirit ascended to heaven.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bondsmen came to Thor after death. This seems to
express the idea, that their spirits had not the power to
mount up with free-born heroes to the higher celestial
abodes, but were obliged to linger midway, as it were,
among the low floating clouds under the stern dominion
of Thor;—a thought painful to the feelings of humanity,
but nevertheless not inconsistent with the views of
our ancestors in ancient times. But when the bondsmen,
as was the custom in the most ancient Gothic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>times, followed their master on the funeral pile, the
motive must have been that they would continue to
serve him in the future life, or their throwing themselves
on their master’s funeral pile could have no
meaning whatever.</p>

<p class='c004'>The old Norsemen had many beautiful ideas in connection
with death. Thus in the lay of Atle it is said
of him who dies that he goes to the other light. That
the dead in the mounds were a state of consciousness
is illustrated by the following passages from Fridthiof’s
Saga:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now, children, lay us in two lofty graves</div>
      <div class='line'>Down by the sea-shore, near the deep-blue waves:</div>
      <div class='line'>Their sounds shall to our souls be music sweet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Singing our dirge as on the strand they beat.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When round the hills the pale moonlight is thrown</div>
      <div class='line'>And midnight dews fall on the Bautn-stone,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll sit, O Thorsten, in one rounded graves</div>
      <div class='line'>And speak together o’er the gentle waves.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Finally, it is a beautiful thought that there was a
sympathetic union between the dead and the living.
As the Persians believed that the rivers of the lower
world grew by the tears of the living and interfered
with the happiness of the departed, so the Norse peasant
still believes that when a daughter weeps for the
death of her father she must take care that no tear
falls on his corpse, for thereby the peace of the deceased
would be disturbed. We find this same thought expressed
in the Elder Edda, where Helge says to Sigrun:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thou alone causest, Sigrun</div>
      <div class='line'>From Sevafjeld,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Helge is bathed</div>
      <div class='line'>In sorrow’s dew.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Thou weepest, gold-adorned,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sunbright woman!</div>
      <div class='line'>Cruel tears,</div>
      <div class='line'>Before thou goest to sleep.</div>
      <div class='line'>Every bloody tear</div>
      <div class='line'>Fell on the king’s breast,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ice-cold and swelling</div>
      <div class='line in4'>With sorrow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus also in the old song of Aage and Else:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whenever thou grievest,</div>
      <div class='line'>My coffin is within</div>
      <div class='line'>As livid blood:</div>
      <div class='line'>Whenever thou rejoicest,</div>
      <div class='line'>My coffin is within</div>
      <div class='line'>Filled with fragrant roses.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='6'>VI</abbr>. LOKE’S PUNISHMENT.</h4>
<p class='c006'>Loke and Balder struggled for the government of the
world. Loke gradually grew victorious in his terrible
children, while Balder, defenseless and innocent, had
nothing but his shining purity with which to oppose
Loke’s baseness. Loke’s wickedness reached its culminating
point in the death of Balder and in the hag
Thok, who with arid tears would wail Balder from Hel.</p>

<p class='c004'>According to the Younger Edda it would seem that
Loke was punished immediately after the death of Balder,
but according to the Elder Edda the banquet of Æger
seems to have taken place after the death of Balder, and
there Loke was present to pour out in words his enmity
to the defeated gods. When Æger had received the large
kettle, that Thor had brought him from the giant Hymer,
he brewed ale for the gods and invited them to a banquet.
The gods and elves were gathered there, but Thor was
not present. Æger’s servants were praised for their attentiveness
and agility. This Loke could not bear to hear,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>and he killed one of them by name Funfeng. The
gods drove him into the woods, but when they had
seated themselves at the table and had begun to drink
he came back again, and asked Elder, the other servant
of Æger, what the gods talked about at the banquet.
They talk about their weapons and about their bravery,
replied Elder, but neither the gods nor the elves speak
well of you. Then, said Loke, I must go into Æger’s
hall, to look at the banquet: scolding and evil words
bring I to the sons of the gods and mix evil in their ale.
Then Loke went into the hall; but when they who were
there saw who had entered, they were all silent. Then
said Loke to the gods:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thirsty I hither</div>
      <div class='line'>To the hall came—</div>
      <div class='line'>Long way I journeyed—</div>
      <div class='line'>The gods to ask</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether one would grant me</div>
      <div class='line'>A drink of the precious mead.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why are ye silent, gods!</div>
      <div class='line'>And sit so stubborn?</div>
      <div class='line'>Have ye lost your tongues?</div>
      <div class='line'>Give me a seat</div>
      <div class='line'>And place at the banquet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or turn me away.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
 <div class='line c014'>BRAGE:</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The gods will never</div>

      <div class='line'>And place at the banquet:</div>

      <div class='line'>To whom they will give</div>
      <div class='line'>Pleasure at the banquet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Loke begins to abuse the gods, and reminds
Odin how they once mixed blood together,—and Vidar
must yield him his seat. But before Loke drank he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>greeted all the gods and goddesses excepting Brage, who
occupied the innermost bench. And now Loke pours
out his abuse upon all the gods and goddesses, much of
which has been given heretofore. His last quarrel is
with Sif, the wife of Thor. But then Beyla hears the
mountains quake and tremble. It is Thor that is coming;
and when he enters the hall he threatens to crush every
bone in Loke’s body; and to him Loke finally yields, for
he knows that Thor carries out his threats. On going
out he heaps curses upon Æger, and hopes that he
(Æger) may never more make banquets for the gods,
but that flames may play upon his realm and burn him
too.</p>

<p class='c004'>Loke now fled and hid himself in the mountains.
There he built him a dwelling with four doors, so that
he could see everything that passed around him. Often
in the daytime he assumed the likeness of a salmon and
concealed himself under the waters of a cascade called
Fraananger Force, where he employed himself in divining
and circumventing whatever stratagems the gods
might have recourse to in order to catch him. One day
as he sat in his dwelling he took flax and yarn and
worked them into meshes, in the manner that nets have
since been made by fishermen. Odin had however, sitting
in Hlidskjalf, discovered Loke’s retreat; and the latter,
becoming aware that the gods were approaching, threw
his net into the fire and ran to conceal himself in the
river. When the gods entered Loke’s house, Kvaser, who
as the most distinguished among them all for his quickness
and penetration, traced out in the hot embers the
vestiges of the net which had been burnt, and told Odin
that it must be an invention to catch fish. Whereupon
they set to work and wove a net after the model they saw
imprinted in the ashes. This net, when finished, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>threw into the river in which Loke had hid himself.
Thor held one end of the net and all the other gods laid
hold of the other end, thus jointly drawing it along the
stream. Notwithstanding all their precautions the net
passed over Loke, who had crept between two stones,
and the gods only perceived that some living thing had
touched the meshes. They therefore cast their net a
second time, hanging so great a weight to it that it everywhere
raked the bed of the river. But Loke, perceiving
that he had but a short distance to the sea, swam onward
and leapt over the net into the force. Tho gods instantly
followed him and divided themselves into two bands.
Thor, wading along in mid-stream, followed the net,
whilst the others dragged it along toward the sea. Loke
then perceived that he had only two chances of escape,—either
to swim out to the sea, or to leap again over the
net. He chose the latter, but as he took a tremendous
leap Thor caught him in his hand. Being however
extremely slippery, he would have escaped had not Thor
held him fast by the tail; and this is the reason why
salmon have had their tails ever since so fine and slim.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gods having thus captured Loke, they dragged
him without commiseration into a cavern, wherein they
placed three sharp-pointed rocks, boring a hole through
each of them. Having also seized Loke’s children, Vale
and Nare, or Narfe, they changed the former into a wolf,
and in this likeness he tore his brother to pieces and
devoured him. The gods then made cords of his intestines,
with which they bound Loke on the points of the
rocks, one cord passing under his shoulders, another
under his loins, and a third under his hams, and afterwards
transformed these cords to fetters of iron. Then
the giantess Skade took a serpent and suspended it over
him in such a manner that the venom should fall into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>his face, drop by drop. But Sigyn, Loke’s wife, stands
by him and receives the drops, as they fall, in a cup,
which she empties as often as it is filled. But while she
is doing this, venom falls upon Loke, which makes him
shriek with horror and twist his body about so violently
that the whole earth shakes; and this produces what men
call earthquakes. There will Loke lie until Ragnarok.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here we have Loke in the form of a salmon. Slippery
as a salmon, is as common an adage in Norseland
as our American: slippery as an eel. Lobe himself makes
the net by which he is caught and ruined. This is very
proper; sin and crime always bring about their own
ruin. The chaining of Loke is one of the grandest
myths in the whole mythology. That Loke represents
fire in its various forms, becomes clearer with every
new fact, every new event in his life. Skade is the
cold mountain stream, that pours its venom upon Loke.
Sigyn takes much of it away, but some of it will, in
spite of her, come in contact with the subterranean fire,
and the earth quakes and the geysers spout their scalding
water. But who cannot see human life represented
in this grand picture? All great convulsions in the
history of man are brought about in the same manner,
and beside the great forces of revolution stand the pious,
gentle and womanly minds who with the cup of religion
or with the eloquence of the pure spirit prevent the
most violent outbreaks of storm among the nations, and
pour their quieting oils upon the disturbed waters. And
who does not remember cases at the shrine of the family,
where the inevitable consequences of man’s folly
and crime produce convulsive crises, misfortunes and
misery, which the wife shares, prevents and moderates
with her soft hand, gentle tears, and soothing words,—always
cheerful and never growing weary. It is woman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>divine work in life, in a quiet manner to bring
consolation and comfort, and never to despair.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the earth and sea in their various manifestations
are represented by various divinities, so the fire also presents
various forms. It is celestial, united with Odin; it
is earthly in the Fenris-wolf, and it is subterranean in
the chained Loke. That Loke symbolizes fire, is also
illustrated by the fact that the common people in Norway,
when they hear the fire crackling, say that Loke
is whipping his children. In a wider sense Loke is in
one word the evil one, the devil. The common people
also know Loke as a divinity of the atmosphere. When
the sun draws water, they say that Loke is drinking
water. When vapors arise from the earth and float about
in the atmosphere, this phenomenon is also ascribed to
Loke. When he sows his oats among the grain, he produces
a peculiar aërial phenomenon, of which the novelist
Blicher speaks in one of his romances, saying that
this trembling motion of the air, which the people call
Loke’s oats, confuses and blinds the eyes. Nay, truly it
confuses and blinds, for we need not take this only in
a literal sense. It is that motion which shocks the
nerves of man when the soul conceives evil thoughts;
it is that nervous concussion which shocks the whole
system of the criminal when he goes to commit his foul
misdeed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having now given a description of Loke,—having
painted with words the character of this wily, mischievous,
sly and deceitful divinity,—we ask, with Petersen,
where is the painter who will present him in living colors
on canvas? We want a personal representation of him.
We want his limbs, his body and his head. Where is
the painter who can give his chin the proper form, his
mouth the right shape, paint his dimples with those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>deep and fine wrinkles when he smiles, and do justice to
his nose and upper lip? Who will paint those delicate
elevations and depressions of his cheeks, that terrible
brilliancy of his eyes, his subtle and crafty forehead, and
his hair at once stiff and wavy? Who will paint this
immortal youth who yet everywhere reveals his old age,
or this old man whose face mocks at everything like a
reckless youth? Here is a theme without a model, a
theme for a master of the art.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='7'>VII</abbr>. THE IRON POST.</h4>
<p class='c006'>The following story from the south of Germany
illustrates how stories can be remodeled and changed as
to their external adornment and still preserve their fundamental
feature. The reader will not fail to discover
Loke in the following tradition, entitled <i>Der Stock im
Eisen</i>, a story which in its most original form must
date back to the time when Loke was known in Germany.</p>

<p class='c004'>Opposite <abbr title='saint'>St.</abbr> Stephen’s Tower in Vienna there is
found, it is said, one of the old landmarks of this city,
the so-called <i>Stock im Eisen</i> (the iron post). It is a
post that has in the course of time become blackened
and charred, and into which nail after nail has been
driven so close together that there is not room for a
single one more, and the post is literally inclosed in an
iron casing. This covering of iron keeps the dry post
in an upright position, and near the ground it is fastened
by an iron ring with unusually wonderful lock. In
olden times this post was a landmark, for to it extended
the great Wienerwald. In connection with it the following
tale is told by <abbr class='spell'>H.</abbr> Meinert:</p>

<p class='c010'>A young good-looking locksmith apprentice, by name Reinbert,
had secretly won the heart and become engaged to his master’s
daughter Dorothea; but there was not much hope that she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>would ever become his wife. One evening the two lovers agreed
to meet outside the city: they forget themselves in their conversation,
in their doubts and their hopes, and hear not the clock
that strikes the hour when the gate of the city is to be closed;
and the lover has forgotten to take money along to get it opened.
But what a misfortune if they should be shut out, what a disgrace
to his beloved, if it should become known that she has spent the
night outside the city, outside of her father’s house, in company
with a man! Suddenly there arises as it were from the ground
a pale man, with the contour of his face sharply marked, with
wonderful flashing eyes, wearing a black cloak and black hat,
and in the latter waves a cock-feather. Reinbert involuntarily
shudders as he sees him, but still he does not forget his misfortune
in being shut out of the city; he therefore explains his
distress to the stranger, and asks him to lend him enough to pay
the gate-watch. Like for like! whispers the stranger into Reinbert’s
ear; if I am to help you and your beloved out of your
distress, then you must promise me upon the salvation of your
soul never any Sunday to neglect the holy mass. Reinbert
hesitates; but it is in fact a pious promise, and necessity knows
no laws. He promises, and the gate opens as it were spontaneously.</p>

<p class='c011'>Four weeks later, when Reinbert sat in his workshop, the
door opens and that strange man enters. Reinbert shudders at
the sight of him; but when the stranger does not even care to
look at him and only asks for his master, he regains his peace
of mind. When the apprentices had called the master, the visitor
ordered an iron fastening, with lock and bolt, and the master is
willing to undertake the work. But now began the stranger (cunning
as Loke) with a wonderful knowledge of details to mention
all the different parts of the lock, explained with great eloquence
the whole plan of it, and took special pains to describe the manner
in which the springs must necessarily be bent and united; and although
both the master and the apprentices had to admit that such
a lock was not without the range of possibilities,—nay, that it
would indeed be a masterpiece,—still their heads began to swim
when they tried to think of its wonderful construction and arrange
the plan in their minds, and they had to admit that they did not
trust themselves to do the work. Then the stranger’s mouth
assumed a deeply-furrowed, indescribably scornful smile; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>he said with contempt: Call yourselves master and apprentices,
when you do not know how to undertake a work that the youngest
one among you can do in less than an hour! The youngest one
among us, murmured the apprentices; do you think that Reinbert
would be able to do it,—he is the youngest one among us? O yes,
said the stranger, he there can do it, or his look must deceive me
much. With these words he called out the astounded Reinbert,
explained to him once more the plan of the lock, and added: If
you do not save the honor of the smiths, the whole world shall
know their disgrace: but if you can get the lock ready within two
hours, no master will refuse you his daughter, after you have
saved his reputation. Yes indeed, said the master, if you can
perform such an impossibility, Dorothea shall be yours. While
the stranger described the nature of the lock, Reinbert had sunk
into deep reflections; to his soul the narrow workshop widened
into a large plain; he saw a beautiful, happy future blooming
before him; by strange and wonderful voices he heard himself
styled the master of masters; and his beloved he saw approaching
him with the bridal wreath entwined in her locks; and just at that
moment he heard his master’s words: If you can perform such an
impossibility, Dorothea shall be yours. He immediately began
his work; it seemed as if he were working with a hundred arms:
each blow of the hammer gave form to a part of the work; by a
peculiar resounding the hammer-blows seemed to multiply, as if
more invisible hands hammered with him, while the stranger in
the red glare of the flame looked like a pillar of fire (Loke). After
the lapse of an hour the work was finished. Apprentices and
master looked at it and examined it, shaking their heads, and with
mouths wide open; but there was no doubt that Reinbert had
accomplished a masterpiece never seen before, and the master
ascribed it to his enthusiasm awakened by his love. The stranger
took the lock and went ahead; the master with Reinbert and all
his apprentices and the members of his family followed, and all
proceeded to the place where the iron post (Stock im Eisen) now
stands. Here the stranger placed an iron chain around the post
and fastened it with Reinbert’s lock. When they returned, the
stranger had disappeared, and with him the key to the marvelous
lock.</p>

<p class='c009'>We omit a part of the story, taking only that part
which has reference to Loke.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>On account of slander, Reinbert had to travel far and wide
before he finally got his beloved Dorothea. A few days after
he had returned, the government issued a proclamation to the
effect that whatever smith could make a key that would open
that lock should thereby get his diploma of mastership. Reinbert
announced himself a candidate, and repaired to his
workshop to make the key. But for the first time his work
did not seem to succeed. The iron was stubborn and would not
assume the form required; and it seemed astonishing to him,
when he at last had succeeded in giving the key the proper
form, and put it into the furnace to temper it, it was turned
and twisted when he took it out again. His impatience grew
into wrath. But when he at length, after many unsuccessful
attempts, had got the key ready and put it into the furnace
and carefully scrutinized to see what it was that thus always
ruined his work, he saw in the midst of the fire a claw seize
after the key, and terror-stricken he discovered that disagreeable
stranger’s twisted face (Loke) staring at him out of the burning
furnace. He quickly snatched the key away, turned it, seized it
with the tongs at the other end, and put it into the fire again;
and lo and behold! when he took it out the handle was somewhat
twisted, but the head preserved its right shape. (We remember
that it was Loke’s fault that the handle of Thor’s hammer
became rather short.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Reinbert now announced to the government that the key
was ready; and the day after the government officials and the
citizens marched in procession to the iron post, and Reinbert’s
key opened the lock. In his enthusiasm at his success he threw
the key high up in the air, but to everybody’s surprise it did
not come down again. It was sought for everywhere, but could
nowhere be found, and Reinbert had to promise to make a new
one some time. To commemorate the fact that it had been possible
to open the lock he drove a nail into the woodon post, and
since that time every smith has done the same when he left
Vienna; thus this post was formed with its numberless nails.</p>

<p class='c011'>Reinbert became a master and married his beloved. Up to
this time he had kept his promise and had attended upon the
holy mass every Sunday; he began to drink and gamble, but he
conscientiously continued to keep his promise. Finally it happens
that he once stayed a little too long at the gambling-house,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>and hastens terrified in order not too late to
church. But the door of <abbr title='saint'>St.</abbr> Stephen’s church is closed. Outside
sits an old woman (Loke assumed the guise of a woman<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a>
after Balder’s death), who, in answer to his question, informs
him that mass is out. Filled with deadly anguish he rushes
back to his comrades, who laughed at him and insisted that, as
as began at half-past eleven o’clock, and as it was only three-quarters
past eleven, the mass could not yet be over. He hastens
back again: the church-door is now open, but at the very
moment he enters, the priest leaves the altar—the mass is over.
The old woman rises, seizes him by the arms, and his soul departs
from him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus the myth develops into traditionary story, and
one story begets another; they wander about from the
south to the north and from the north to the south,
and change with the times, reminding us of the various
manifestations of life; reminding us how human things
circulate and develop, each inextricably interwoven with
all, and always reminding us, too, that there is a heaven
above the earth and an existence beyond what is allotted
to us mortals on earth.</p>
<h4 class='c015'>SECTION <abbr title='8'>VIII</abbr>. A BRIEF REVIEW.</h4>
<p class='c006'>We have now completed the second part of our
work, and witnessed the life and exploits of the gods.
It remains now to sum up briefly the main features of,
and the principal lessons taught in, this portion of the
mythology.</p>

<p class='c004'>We cannot fail to have observed that the life of the
gods is, in the first place, a reflection of the workings
of visible nature, and, in the second place, a reflection
and foreshadowing of the life of man, particularly of
life in its various manifestations in the history of the
Gothic race. We have also witnessed how wonderfully
the interests and works of the gods—nay, how absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>the gods themselves—are interlinked with each
other,—that centralizing thought which, as has been
said before, forms one of the most prominent characteristics
of Norse or Gothic mythology, thought and
history.</p>

<p class='c004'>We have seen how the divinities and demons, after
having been created, enter upon various activities, contend
with each other and are reconciled, and how new
beings are developed in this struggle, all destined to
fight on one side or the other in the final conflict.</p>

<p class='c004'>The myth reflects nature and society, the one inextricably
in communion with the other; and in the development
of nature and society we find three relations:
the relation of the asas to the giants, the relation of the
asas to the vans, and the relation of Loke to Odin. The
asas and the giants try to unite, but meet with poor success,
their natures are too opposite. The union of the asas
and vans is accomplished with but little difficulty; while
between Odin and Loke there is a tendency to separate
more and more. The beginning of warfare between the
gods and the giants is the beginning of nature’s development;
the giants storm the heavens and are repulsed;
this struggle lasts through life, and in it Sleipner is
produced. Later, begins the war between the asas and
vans, which ends in peace, and with this peace begins
the development of society; the asas and vans together
forming a series of beautiful myths, that have reference
to war, to the cultivation of the earth, to the civilizing
influences of the water, to the greater development of
the mind and heart,—that is, to knowledge, love, humanity
and peace,—the object of which reconciliation,
reached by labor and struggles. But enmity soon
arises among the gods themselves. Odin’s union with
Loke is dissolved. In the midst of the good there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>evil. The evil proceeds from the good by separation,
by taking a wrong course. The unity of the spirit
is destroyed when anything tears itself loose from it
and assumes an independent position in opposition to
it. Loke separates himself from Odin and develops
himself independently. He acts like Odin; he permeates
all nature and the soul of man; but he does it independently,
and the result is that the powers of evil
spread over the earth in the form of Loke’s children.
Everything becomes wild and tumultuous. Fire rages
in its frantic fury in the character of the Fenris-wolf.
The Midgard-serpent represents the furious convulsions
of the sea; cowardice seizes the heart and begets the
pale Hel, death without conflict, life as a mere shadow.
Thus it goes on. Knowledge rightly used is a blessing, but
unconstrained by prudence it degenerates into cunning
and deceitfulness; killing is honorable, but unconstrained
by justice and valor it becomes foul murder; to break a
promise that can no longer be kept is proper, but when
done recklessly it is perjury. We find, throughout the
life of the gods, light and darkness well defined and
distinctly separated. Loke fluctuates between the two;
he gradually leaves light and unites himself to darkness.
The darkness of night supplants the light of day; the
gloomy winter overcomes the shining summer. The gods
learn that they are subject to the infirmities of old age;
the rejuvenating Idun sinks into the abyss. From the
depths below, Odin receives warnings that the light of
life may be extinguished. Loke begins his conflict with
Balder; finally his stratagem and cunning gain a victory,
and all the sorrowing of nature is in vain. Loke
is chained, but Balder does not return from Hel. Vale
has avenged his brother’s death, but the end of life is
at hand. And now we are prepared for <span class='sc'>Ragnarok</span>,
followed by the <span class='fss'>REGENERATION OF THE EARTH</span>.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>The final destruction of the world, and regeneration
of gods and men, is called Ragnarok; that is, the
Twilight of the gods (<i>Ragna</i>, from <i>regin</i>, gods, and
<i>rökr</i>, darkness).</p>

<p class='c004'>The journey through life has been a long one, and
yet we have not reached the end, for the end is also the
beginning. Death is the center, where the present and
future existence meet. When life ends, there is a
change, there comes a new day and a sun without a
shadow.</p>

<p class='c004'>In comparing the Greek mythology with the Norse,
it was stated, that the Norse has a theoktonic myth,
while the Greek lacks the final act of the grand drama.
The Greeks knew of no death of the gods; their gods
were immortal. And yet, what were they but an ideal
conception of the forms of life? And this life with all
its vanity, pomp and glory, the Greek loved so dearly,
that he thought it must last forever. He imagined an
everlasting series of changes. But what will then the
final result be? Shall the thundering Zeus forever continue
to thunder? Shall the faithless Aphrodite forever
be unfaithful? Shall Typhon forever go on with his
desolations? Shall the sinner continue to sin forever,
and shall the world continue without end to foster and
nourish evil? These are questions that find no satisfactory
answer in the Greek mythology.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>Among the Norsemen, on the other hand, we find
in their most ancient records a clearly expressed faith
in the perishableness of all things; and we find this
faith at every step that the Norsemen has taken. The
origin of this faith we seek in vain; it conceals itself
beneath the waters of the primeval fountains of their
thoughts and aspirations. They regarded death as but
the middle of a long life. They considered it cowardice
to spare a life that is to return; they thought it folly to
care for a world that must necessarily perish; while
they knew that their spirits would be clothed with
increased vigor in the other world. Happy were they
who lived beneath the polar star, for the greatest fear
that man knows, the fear of death, disturbed them not.
They rushed cheerfully upon the sword; they entered
the battle boldly, for, like their gods, who every moment
looked forward to the inevitable Ragnarok, they knew
that life could be purchased by a heroic death.</p>

<p class='c004'>The very fact that the gods in the creation proceeded
from the <i>giant</i> Ymer foreshadowed their destruction.
The germ of death was in their nature from the beginning,
and this germ would gradually develop as their
strength gradually became wasted and consumed. That
which is born must die, but that which is not born
cannot grow old.</p>

<p class='c004'>The gradual growth of this germ of death, and corresponding
waste of the strength of the gods, is profoundly
sketched throughout the mythology. The gods
cannot be conquered, unless they make themselves weak;
but such is the very nature of things, that they must do
this. To win the charming Gerd, Frey must give away
his sword, but when the great final conflict comes he
has no weapon. In order that the Fenris-wolf may be
chained, Tyr must risk his right hand, and he loses it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>How shall he then fight in Ragnarok? Balder could
not have died, had not the gods been blind and presumptuous;
their thoughtlessness put weapons into the hands
of their enemy. Hoder would never have thrown the
fatal mistletoe, had not their own appointed game been
an inducement to him to honor his brother. When Loke
became separated from Odin, the death of the gods was a
foregone conclusion.</p>

<p class='c004'>The imperfection of nature is also vividly depicted
in the Eddas. The sun was so scorching hot that the
gods had to place a shield before it; the fire was so
destructive that the gods had to chain it, in order that
it might not bring ruin upon the whole world. Life,
after the natural death, was not continued only in the
shining halls of Valhal, but also in the subterranean
regions among the shades of Hel.</p>

<p class='c004'>Our old Gothic fathers, in the poetic dawn of our
race, investigated the origin and beginning of nature
and time. The divine poetic and imaginative spark in
them lifted them up to the Eternal, to that wonderful
secret fountain which is the source of all things. They
looked about them in profound meditation to find the
image and reflection of that glorious harmony which
their soul in its heavenly flight had found, but in all
earthly things they discovered strife and warfare. When
the storms bent the pine trees on the mountain tops,
and when the foaming waves rolled in gigantic fury
against the rocky cliffs, the Norseman saw strife. When
the growl of the bear and the howl of the wolf blended
with the moaning of the winds and the roaring of the
waters, he heard strife. In unceasing conflict with the
earth, with the beasts and with each other, he saw men
stand, conquer, and fall. If he lifted his weary eye
toward the skies, he saw the light struggling with darkness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>and with itself. When light arose out of darkness,
it was greeted with enthusiasm; when it sank again
into darkness, its rays were broken and it dissolved in
glimmering colors; and if he looked down into the
heart of man, into his own breast, he found that all
this conflict of opposing elements in the outward world
did but faintly symbolize that terrible warfare pervading
and shattering his whole being. Well might he long
for peace, and can we wonder that this deep longing
for rest and peace, which filled his heart in the midst
of all his struggles,—can we wonder, we say, that his
longing for peace found a grand expression in a final
conflict through which imperishableness and harmony
were attained?</p>

<p class='c004'>This final conflict, this dissolution of nature’s and
life’s disharmony, the Edda presents to us in the death
of the gods, which is usually, as stated, called Ragnarok.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is nothing more sublime in poetry than the
description, in the Eddas, of Ragnarok. It is preceded
by ages of crime and terror. The vala looks down
into Niflheim,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There saw she wade</div>
      <div class='line'>In the heavy streams</div>
      <div class='line'>Men—foul murderers,</div>
      <div class='line'>And perjurers,</div>
      <div class='line'>And them who other’s wives</div>
      <div class='line'>Seduce to sin.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The growing depravity and strife in the world proclaim
the approach of this great event. First there is
a winter called Fimbul-winter, during which snow will
fall from the four corners of the world; the frosts will
be very severe, the winds piercing, the weather tempestuous,
and the sun will impart no gladness. Three
such winters shall pass away without being tempered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>by a single summer. Three other similar winters follow,
during which war and discord will spread over the whole
earth. Brothers for the sake of mere gain shall kill
each other, and no one shall spare either his parents
or his children. Thus the Elder Edda:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Brothers slay brothers;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sisters’ children</div>
      <div class='line'>Shed each other’s blood.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hard is the world;</div>
      <div class='line'>Sensual sin grows huge.</div>
      <div class='line'>There are sword-ages, ax-ages;</div>
      <div class='line'>Shields are cleft in twain;</div>
      <div class='line'>Storm-ages, murder-ages;</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the world falls dead,</div>
      <div class='line'>And men no longer spare</div>
      <div class='line'>Or pity one another.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then shall happen such things as may truly be
regarded as great miracles. The Fenris-wolf shall devour
the sun, and a severe loss will that be to mankind.
The other wolf<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a> will take the moon, and this, too, will
cause great mischief. Then the stars shall be hurled
from the heavens, and the earth shall be shaken so
violently that trees will be torn up by the roots, the
tottering mountains will tumble headlong from their
foundations, and all bonds and fetters will be shivered
to pieces. The Fenris-wolf then breaks loose and the
sea rushes over the earth on account of the Midgard-serpent
writhing in giant rage and gaining the land.
On the waters floats the ship Naglfar (nail-ship), which
is constructed of the nails of dead men. For this reason
great care should be taken to die with pared nails, for
he who dies with his nails unpared supplies materials
for the building of this ship, which both gods and men
wish may be finished as late as possible. But in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>flood shall Naglfar float, and the giant Hrym be its
steersman.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Fenris-wolf advances and opens his enormous
mouth; the lower jaw reaches to the earth and the
upper one to heaven, and he would open it still wider
had he room to do so. Fire flashes from his eyes and
nostrils. The Midgard-serpent, placing himself by the
side of the Fenris-wolf, vomits forth floods of poison,
which fill the air and the waters. Amidst this devastation
the heavens are rent in twain, and the sons of
Muspel come riding through the opening in brilliant
array. Surt rides first, and before and behind him
flames burning fire. His sword outshines the sun itself.
Bifrost (the rainbow), as they ride over it, breaks to
pieces. Then they direct their course to the battle-field
called Vigrid. Thither repair also the Fenris-wolf and
the Midgard-serpent, and Loke with all the followers of
Hel, and Hrym with all the frost-giants. But the sons
of Muspel keep their effulgent bands apart on the battle-field,
which is one hundred miles (rasts) on each side.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile Heimdal arises, and with all his strength
he blows the Gjallar-horn to arouse the gods, who assemble
without delay. Odin then rides to Mimer’s fountain
and consults Mimer how he and his warriors are to enter
into action. The ash Ygdrasil begins to quiver, nor is
there anything in heaven or on earth that does not fear
and tremble in that terrible hour. The gods and all the
einherjes of Valhal arm themselves with speed and sally
forth to the field, led on by Odin with his golden helmet,
resplendent cuirass, and spear called Gungner. Odin
places himself against the Fenris-wolf. Thor stands by
his side, but can render him no assistance, having himself
to combat the Midgard-serpent. Frey encounters
Surt, and terrible blows are exchanged ere Frey falls;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>and he owes his defeat to his not having that trusty
sword which he gave to Skirner. That day the dog
Garm, that had been chained in the Gnipa-cave, breaks
loose. He is the most fearful monster of all, and attacks
Tyr, and they kill each other. Thor gains great renown
for killing the Midgard-serpent, but at the same time,
retreating nine paces, he falls dead upon the spot, suffocated
with the floods of venom which the dying serpent
vomits forth upon him. The wolf swallows Odin, but
at that instant Vidar advances, and setting his foot upon
the monster’s lower jaw he seizes the other with his hand,
and thus tears and rends him till he dies. Vidar is able
to do this because he wears those shoes which have
before been mentioned, and for which stuff has been
gathered in all ages, namely, the shreds of leather which
are cut off to form the toes and heels of shoes; and it
is on this account that those who desire to render
service to the gods should take care to throw such shreds
away. Loke and Heimdal fight and kill each other.
Then Surt flings fire and flame over the world. Smoke
wreathes up around the all-nourishing tree (Ygdrasil),
the high flames play against the heavens, and earth
consumed sinks down beneath the sea.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The wolf referred to in the first strophe is Maanegarm
(the moon-devourer), of whom we have made
notice before. The hag in the Ironwood is Angerboda
(anguish-boding), with whom Loke begat children. Evil
is being developed. The gods become through Loke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>united with the giants. The wood is of iron, hard and
barren; the children are ravenous wolves. On the hill-top
sits Egder (an eagle), a storm-eagle, the howling
wind that rushes through the wood, and howling wind
is the music produced upon his harp. The cock is a
symbol of fire, and it is even to this day a common
expression among the Norsemen, when a fire breaks
out, that <i>the red cock is crowing over the roof of the
house</i>. There are three cocks, one in the bird-wood,
one in heaven, and one in the lower regions with Hel.
The idea then is, that the cock as a symbol of fire announces
the coming of Ragnarok in all the regions of the
world. The vala continues:</p>

<p class='c009'>These strophes are taken from Völuspá (the prophecy
of the vala); and besides these we also have a few
strophes of the lay of Vafthrudner, in the Elder Edda,
referring to the final conflict:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>

      <div class='line'>What of Odin will</div>

      <div class='line'>When the powers perish?</div>

      <div class='line'>Will cleave</div>
      <div class='line'>In conflict with the wolf.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The terrible dog mentioned several times is Hel’s
bloody-breasted and murderous hound. Like the Fenris-wolf
and Loke, this dog had been bound at Gnipa-cave,
although the Eddas tell us nothing about when or how
this was done.</p>

<p class='c004'>When it is said that another woe comes over Hlin,
the maid-servant is placed for Frigg herself; and the
former woe implied is the death of Balder, <i>the other woe</i>
meaning the approaching death of Odin.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is worthy of notice, that as this final conflict is
inevitable, the gods proceed to it, not with despair and
trembling, but joyfully and fearlessly as to a game, for
it is the last. Odin rides to the battle adorned; he
knows that he must die, and for this very reason he
decorates himself as does a bride for the wedding, and
the gods follow him; even those who are defenseless
voluntarily expose themselves on the plain of Vigrid.
They are determined to die.</p>

<p class='c004'>Which are the powers that now oppose each other?
On the one side we have those who have ruled and
blessed heaven and earth; and fighting against them
we find their eternal enemies, those powers which had
sprung into being before heaven and earth were created,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>and those which had developed in the earth and in the
sea, and which no asa-might can conquer. From Muspelheim
come the sons of Muspel in shining armor;
from Muspel’s world came originally the sun, moon and
stars. It is a fundamental law in nature that all things
destroy themselves, all things contain an inherent force
that finally brings ruin; that is the meaning of perishableness
or corruption. A second host consists of the
frost-giants.  From the body of the old giant Ymer
was formed the earth, the sea, the mountains, the trees,
etc.; the giants must therefore assist in the destruction
of their own work. The third host is Loke and his
children, born in time and the offspring of that which
was created. They are the destructive elements in that
which was created; the ocean becoming a fierce serpent,
mid the fire a devouring wolf. Loke himself is the
volcanic fire which the earth has produced within its
bowels; and then there is all that is cowardly represented
by the pale Hel with her bloodless shadows, the
life which has turned into shadowy death. All these
forces oppose each other. Those who fought in life
mutually conquer each other in death. Odin, whose
heaven is the source of all life, is slain by the Fenris-wolf,
the earthly fire, which has brought all kinds of
activities into the life of man; but the wolf, after he
has conquered, falls again at the hands of Vidar, the
imperishable, incorruptible force of nature. In this duel
heaven and earth are engaged. The god of the clouds,
Thor, contends with the Midgard-serpent,—many a
struggle they have had together; now the clouds and
ocean mutually destroy each other. Since the death of
Balder, Frey is the most pure and shining divinity.
His pure and noble purpose and longing are still within
him, but his sword, his power, is gone. Hence he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>stricken down by Surt, the warder of Muspelheim.
Heimdal stretched his brilliant rainbow over the earth,
Loke his variegated stream of fire within the earth;
the one proclaiming mercies and blessings, the other
destruction; both perish in Ragnarok. Hel and her
pale host also betake themselves to the final contest,
but the Eddas say nothing about their taking part in the
fight. How can they? They are nothing but emptiness,
the mere vanity of the heart, in which there is no
substance; they are but the darkness which enwraps the
earth, and are not capable of deeds.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus is Ragnarok! The great antagonism pervading
the world is removed in a final struggle, in which the
contending powers mutually destroy each other. Ragnarok
is an outbreak of all the chaotic powers, a conflict
between them and the established order of creation.
Fire, water, darkness and death work together to destroy
the world. The gods and their enemies meet in a universal,
world-embracing wrestle and duel, and mutually
destroy each other. The flames of Surt, the supreme
fire-god, complete the overthrow, and the last remnant
of the consumed earth sinks into the ocean.</p>

<p class='c009'>Vidar and Vale survive; neither the flood nor Surt’s
flame has harmed them, and they dwell on the plain of
Ida, where Asgard formerly stood. Thither come the
sons of Thor, Mode and Magne, bringing with them
their father’s hammer, Mjolner. Hœner is there also,
and comprehends the future. Balder and Hoder sit and
converse together; they call to mind their former knowledge
and the perils they underwent, and the fight with
the wolf Fenrer, and with the Midgard-serpent. The
sons of Hoder and Balder inhabit the wide Wind-home.
The sun brings forth a daughter more lovely than herself,
before she is swallowed by Fenrer; and when the
gods have perished, the daughter rides in her mother’s
heavenly course.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the conflagration caused by Surt’s fire, a
woman by name Lif (life) and a man named Lifthraser
lie concealed in Hodmimer’s forest. The dew of the
dawn serves then for food, and so great a race shall
spring from them that their descendants shall soon
spread over the whole earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Toward the north on the Nida-mountains stands a
large hall of shining gold, which the race of Sindre,
that is the dwarfs, occupy. There is also another hall
called Brimer, which is also in heaven, in the region
Okolner, and there all who delight in quaffing good drink
will find plenty in store for them. Good and virtuous
beings inhabit all these halls.</p>

<p class='c004'>But there is also a place of punishment. It is called
Naastrand (strand of dead bodies). In Naastrand there
is a vast and terrible structure, with doors that face to
the north. It is built entirely of the backs of serpents,
wattled together like wicker-work. But all the serpents’
heads are turned toward the inside of the hall, and continually
vomit forth floods of venom, in which wade all
those who have committed murder, perjury, or adultery.
The vala, in the Elder Edda,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Or as it is stated in Hyndla’s lay, after she has described
Heimdal, the sublime protector of the perishable
world:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then comes another</div>

      <div class='line'>To meet the wolf.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And when the vale in Völuspá, beginning with the
primeval time, has unveiled, in the most profound sentences,
the whole history of the universe,—when she
has gone through every period of its development down
through Ragnarok and the Regeneration, the following
is her last vision:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>There</i> comes the dark</div>
      <div class='line'>Dragon<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a> flying,</div>
      <div class='line'>The shining serpent</div>
      <div class='line'>From the Nida-mountains</div>
      <div class='line'>In the deep.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>Over the plain it flies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Dead bodies Nidhug</div>
      <div class='line'>Drags in his whizzing plumage,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Now must Nidhug sink.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Thus ends the vala’s prophecy (<i>völuspá</i>.) She has
revealed the decrees of the Father of Nature; she has
described the conflagration and renovation of the world,
and now proclaims the fate of the good and of the evil.</p>

<p class='c004'>The world and the things in it perish, but not the
forces. Some of the gods reappear in the regenerated
earth, while some do not. They who reappear are mentioned
in pairs, excepting Hœner, who is alone. Balder
and Hoder are together; likewise Vidar and Vale, and
Mode and Magne. Neither Odin nor Thor nor the vans
appear. They perished with the world, for they represented
the developing forces of this world; they were
divinities representing that which came into being and
had existence in it. On the other hand, Balder and
Hoder came back from Hel. They represent light and
darkness; but they are alike in this respect, that they
are nothing substantial, nothing real, they are only the
condition for something to be, or we might say they are
the space, the firmament, in which something may exist.
They are the two brothers whose sons shall inhabit the
wide Wind-home. Thus when heaven and earth have
passed away there is nothing remaining but the wide
expanse of space with light and darkness, who not only
rule together in perfect harmony, but also permeate each
other and neutralize each other.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hœner comes back. He was originally one of the
trinity with Odin and Loder (Loke); but the gods received
Njord as a hostage from the vans, and gave to
the vans in return Hœner, as a security of friendship
between them. This union between the asas and vans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>is now dissolved. Hœner has nothing more to do among
the vans. Their works all perished with the old earth.
He is the developing, creative force that is needed now
in the new world as it was in the old.</p>

<p class='c004'>Vidar is the imperishable force in original nature,
that is, in crude nature, but at the same time united
with the gods. He is the connecting link between gods
and giants. His mother was Grid, a giantess, and his
father was Odin. The strong Vale begotten of Odin and
Rind (the slumbering earth) is the imperishable force
of nature which constantly renews itself in the earth as
a habitation of man. Both Vidar and Vale are avenging
gods. Vale avenges the death of Balder, and Vidar the
death of Odin, and thus we have in Vidar and Vale representatives
of the imperishable force of nature in two
forms, the one without and the other within the domain
of man, both purified and renewed in the regenerated
earth.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the atmosphere and in the dense clouds reigned
Thor, with his flashing fire and clattering thunder.
Thunder and lightning have passed away, but the forces
that produced them, courage and strength, are preserved
in Thor’s sons, Mode (courage) and Magne (strength).
They have their father’s hammer, Mjolner, and with it
they can strike to the right and to the left, permeating
the new heaven and new earth. What a well of
profound thought are the Eddas!</p>

<p class='c004'>The parents of the new race of men are called Lif
and Lifthraser. Life cannot perish. It lies concealed in
Hodmimer’s forest, which the flame of Surt was not able
to destroy. The new race of mankind seem to possess a
far nobler nature than the former, for they subsist on
the morning dew.</p>

<p class='c004'>Do Mimer and Surt live? They are the fundamental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>elements of fire and water. The Eddas are not clear on
this point, but an affirmative answer seems to be suggested
in the fact that the better part of every being is preserved.</p>

<p class='c004'>The good among men find their reward in Gimle;
for he that made man gave him a soul, which shall live
and never perish, though the body shall have mouldered
away or have been burnt to ashes; and all that are
righteous shall dwell with him in the place called Gimle,
says the Younger Edda. The dwarfs have their Sindre,
and their golden hall on the Nida-mountains; and the
giant has his shining drinking hall, Brimer, but it is
situated in Okolner (not cool), where there is no more
frost.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Elder Edda seems to point out two places of
punishment for men. Giants and dwarfs are not punished,
for they act blindly, they have no free will. But
the wicked of mankind go to Naastrand and wade in
streams of serpent-venom, and thence they appear to be
washed down into Hvergelmer, that horrible old kettle,
where their bodies are torn by Nidhug, the dragon of the
uttermost darkness.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a day of judgment. The good and bad are
separated. The god, whom the Edda dare not name, is
the judge. The Younger Edda once calls him Allfather,
for he is to the new world what Odin was to the old. He
was before the beginning of time, and at the end of time
he enters upon his eternal reign.</p>

<p class='c004'>The reward is eternal. Is the punishment also eternal?
When light and darkness (Balder and Hoder) can
live peaceably together,—when darkness can resolve itself
into light,—cannot then the evil be dissolved in the
good; cannot the eternal streams of goodness wash away
the evil? We think so, and the Edda seems to justify
us in this thought; at least the Elder Edda seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>take this view of the subject. Listen again to the last
vision of the vala:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>There</i> comes the dark</div>
      <div class='line'>Dragon flying,</div>
      <div class='line'>The shining serpent</div>
      <div class='line'>From the Nida-mountains</div>
      <div class='line'>In the deep.</div>
      <div class='line'>Over the plain it flies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Dead bodies Nidhug</div>
      <div class='line'>Drags in his whizzing plumage,—</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Now must Nidhug sink</i>.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When there is an intermediate state, a transition, a
purification, a purgatory, then this purification must
sooner or later be accomplished; and that is the day of
the great judgment, <i>when Nidhug must sink</i>, and nevermore
lift his wings loaded with dead bodies. This idea
is beautifully elaborated in <i>Zendavista</i>. The Edda has
it in a single line, but the majority of its interpreters
have not comprehended it. We who are permeated by
the true Christian spirit, we know how great joy there
is in heaven over a sinner who is converted; we know
the God of mercy, who does not desire the ruin of a
single sinner, and the God of omnipotence, who with
his hand is able to press the tears of repentance from
the heart, though it be hard as steel; we comprehend
why he lets Nidhug sink down. All darkness shall be
cleared up and be gilded by the shining light of heaven.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>Such was the origin, the development, the destruction
and regeneration of the world. And now, says the
Younger Edda, as it closes the deluding of King Gylfe,
if you have any further questions to ask, I know not
who can answer you; for I never heard tell of anyone
who could relate what will happen in the other ages of
the world. Make therefore the best use you can of
what has been imparted to you.</p>

<p class='c004'>Upon this Ganglere heard a terrible noise all around
him. He looked, but could see neither palace nor city
anywhere, nor anything save a vast plain. He therefore
set out on his return to his kingdom, where he related
all that he had seen and heard; and ever since that
time these tidings have been handed down from man to
man by oral tradition, and we add, may the stream of
story never cease to flow! May the youth, the vigorous
man, and the grandfather with his silvery locks, forever
continue to refresh their minds by looking into and
drinking from the fountain that reflects the ancient history
of the great Gothic race!</p>

<p class='c004'>In closing, we would present this question: Shall
we have northern art? We have southern art (Hercules
and Hebe), we have oriental art (Adam and Eve), and
now will some one complete the trilogy by adding Loke
and Sigyn? Ay, let us have another Thorvaldsen, and
let him devote himself to <i>northern art</i>. Here is a new
and untrodden field for the artist. Ye Gothic poets and
painters and sculptors! why stand ye here idle?</p>

is the so-called <i>Elder Edda</i>. Then there is the <i>Younger
Edda</i>, a name applied to a work written by Snorre Sturleson,

rules for verse-making. The ancients applied the name
<i>Edda</i> only to this work of Snorre. The <i>Elder Edda</i> was

<i>Middle-garth</i>, <i>Low-garth</i>.] The mid-yard, middle-town,
that is, the earth, is a mythological word common to all the
ancient Teutonic languages. Ulfilas renders the Gr. [Greek: oikoumenê]
by <i>midjungards</i>; Heliand calls the earth <i>middil-gard</i>;
the Anglo-Saxon homilies, instead of earth, say <i>middan-geard</i>
(<i>meddlert</i>, Jamieson), and use the word us an appellative;
but the Icelandic Edda alone has preserved the true
mythical bearing of this old Teutonic word. The earth
(Midgard), the abode of men, is seated in the middle of the
universe, bordered by mountains and surrounded by the great
sea (<i>ûthaf</i>); on the other side of this sea is the Utgard
(out-yard), the abode of the giants; the Midgard is
defended by the yard to burgh Asgard (the burgh of the
gods) lying in the middle (the heaven being conceived as
rising above the earth). Thus the earth and mankind are
represented as a stronghold besieged by the powers of evil
from without, defended by the gods from above and from
within. <i>Midgard.</i></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Miðgarðsormr</span> [The serpent of Midgaard]. The world-serpent

In Ragnarok Thor slays him, but falls himself poisoned by
his breath. <i>Midgard-serpent.</i></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Mímameiðr.</span> A mythic tree; no doubt the same as Ygdrasil.
It derives its name from Mimer, and means Mimer’s tree.
<i>Mimameider.</i></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Mímir.</span> The name of the wise giant keeper of the holy well
Mímis-brunnr, the burn (bourn, brun) of Mimer, the well of
wisdom, in which Odin pawned his eye for wisdom; a myth
which is explained as symbolical of the heavenly vault with
its single eye, the sun, setting in the sea. Is the likeness of
the word to the Latin <i>memor</i> only accidental? The true
etymology of Mímir is not known. <i>Mimer.</i></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Mjölnir.</span>  [The derivation from <i>mala</i> or <i>mola</i> (to crush) is,
though probable, not certain. The word may be akin to
Goth. <i>milhma</i>, cloud; Swed. <i>moln</i>; Dan. <i>mulm</i>; Norse <i>molnas</i>
(Ivor Aasen), to grow dark from bands of clouds arising.]
Thor’s formidable hammer. After Ragnarok, it is possessed

<i>mistel</i> or <i>mistel-tâ</i>; Eng. <i>mistletoe</i>]. The mistletoe or mistle-twig,
the fatal twig by which Balder, the white sun-god, was
slain. After the death of Balder, Ragnarok set in. Balder’s
death was also symbolical of the victory of darkness over
light, which comes every year at midwinter. The mistletoe
in English households at Christmas time is no doubt a relic
of a rite lost in the remotest heathendom, for the fight of
light and darkness at midwinter was a foreshadowing of the
final overthrow in Ragnarok. The legend and the word are
common to all Teutonic peoples of all ages. <i>Mistletoe.</i></p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Móði</span> [Courage]. A son of Thor. <i>Mode.</i></p>

to appear at Ragnarok and destroy the world by fire. <i>Muspel.</i>
(See next word.)</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='sc'>Múspellsheimr.</span> The abode of Muspel. This interesting word
(<i>Múspell</i>) was not confined to the Norse mythology, but
appears twice in the old Saxon poem Heliand, thus: (1)
<i>mutspelli cumit on thiustra naht, also thiof ferit</i> (<i>mutspelli</i>
comes in dusky night, as a thief fares,—that is, But the day
of the Lord will come as a thief in the night), and (2)
<i>mutspellis megin obar man ferit</i> (the main of <i>mutspelli</i> fares
over men). A third instance is an Old High German poem
on the Last Day, thus: <i>dâr ni mac denne mac andremo helfan
vora demo muspille</i> (there no man can help another against
the <i>muspel-doom</i>). In these instances <i>muspel</i> stands for the
<i>day of judgment</i>, <i>the last day</i>, and answers to Ragnarok of
the Norse mythology. The etymology is doubtful, for <i>spell</i>
may be the <i>weird</i>, <i>doom</i>, Lat. <i>fatum</i>; or it may be <i>spoil</i>,
<i>destruction</i>. The former part, <i>mús</i> or <i>muod</i>, is more difficult
to explain. The Icelandic <i>mús</i> is an assimilated form. <i>Muspelheim.</i></p>

<i>thunar</i>; Danish <i>tor</i>, in <i>tor</i>-den (compare Lat. <i>tono</i> and
<i>tonitrus</i>.) The word <i>Þórr</i> is therefore formed by absorption
of the middle <i>n</i>, and contraction of an old dissyllabic <i>þonor</i>
into one syllable, and is a purely Scandinavian form; hence
in Anglo-Saxon charters or diplomas it is a sure sign of
forgery when names compounded with <i>þur</i>- appear in deeds
pretending to be of a time earlier than the Danish invasion
in the ninth century; although in later times they abound.
The English <i>Thursday</i> is a later form, in which the phonetic
rule of the Scandinavian tongue has been followed;
but perhaps it is a North English form]. The god of
thunder, keeper of the hammer, the ever-fighting slayer of
trolls and destroyer of evil spirits, the friend of mankind,
the defender of the earth, the heavens and the gods; for
without Thor and his hammer the earth would become the
helpless prey of the giants. He was the consecrator, the
hammer being the cross or holy sign of the ancient heathen,
hence the expressive phrase on a heathen Danish runic
stone: <i>Þurr vigi þassi runar</i> (Thor consecrate these runes!)
Thor was the son of Odin and Fjorgyn (mother earth); he
was blunt, hot-tempered, without fraud or guile, of few
words and ready stroke—such was Thor, the favorite deity
of our forefathers. The finest legends of the Younger
Edda and the best lays of the Elder Edda refer to Thor.
His hall is Bilskirner. He slays Thjasse, Thrym, Hrungner,

that the common reading of this passage <i>hon</i> ought to be <i>hann</i>,—that is <i>he</i>, not
<i>she</i>. In our translation we have supplied the noun <i>Nidhug</i>, while if we had
followed the other authorities we would have used the noun <i>vala</i>. Petersen
remarks that the word sink (<i>sökkvask</i>) is a natural expression when applied to
the dragon, who sinks into the abyss, but forced and unnatural when applied
to the vala. He also quotes another passage (the last line in Brynhild’s Hel-ride,
where Brynhild says to the hag: Sink thou (<i>sökkstu!</i>) of giantkind!)
from the Elder Edda which corroborates his view. As the reader will observe,
we have adopted Petersen’s view entirely.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
